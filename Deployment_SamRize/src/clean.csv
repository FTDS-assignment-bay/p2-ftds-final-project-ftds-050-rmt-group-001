0,"Samsung Galaxy Z Fold7 Cell Phone, 512GB AI Smartphone, Unlocked Android, AI Photo Edits, Large Screen, Long Battery Life, 2025, US 1 Yr Manufacturer Warranty, JetBlack",2119.99,4400,"Expand what’s possible with Galaxy Z Fold7, the foldable that’s designed to do so much more than before.","I’ve used Samsung’s Ultra and Note series for years, so I’m very familiar with wide, boxy phones and large displays. That’s why, when I first got the Z Fold 7, the cover screen initially felt narrow compared to what I was used to. In height it’s almost the same, but the width seemed smaller. However, this feeling only lasted a few days—once I adjusted, I realized the cover display is more than enough for everyday use. In fact, it’s very similar in size to the S25 Plus, and you can comfortably run any app on it. The magic happens when you unfold it. The internal display is huge, immersive, and makes you forget about missing the wider Ultra screen. You can run two apps side by side, or one above the other, almost like having two phones in one. For example, you can keep your email open on one side while chatting or receiving information on the other—copying, pasting, and multitasking without constantly switching apps. You can also watch a video on one half while replying to emails, chatting on WhatsApp, or doing other tasks on the other half. It’s an unmatched experience that no regular phone can offer. Multitasking and Apps Multitasking on the Fold is incredible. Editing photos, playing games, or browsing is simply more fun on such a large display. Most apps are optimized because Samsung’s software is excellent, and social apps like Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook look fantastic. If you ever prefer a narrower aspect ratio, you can quickly switch any app to “slim mode” through the multitasking options. Addressing the Haters’ Complaints Under-display camera: You can enable a black bar in apps to hide the camera area, so it never gets in the way. S Pen: While there’s no built-in S Pen slot, you can use a capacitive S Pen. By enabling “increased touch sensitivity” (especially if you use a tempered glass screen protector), it works very well for everyday use. Battery life: After weeks of use, I can confirm the battery lasts all day. With adaptive power saving and dark mode, I’ve managed up to 10 hours of screen time on the cover screen, and 7–8 hours with mixed cover and main screen use. Heavy gaming or demanding apps bring it down to 5–6 hours, which is still solid. To preserve long-term battery health, I recommend enabling battery protection (charging to 90–95%) and avoiding letting it drop below 30%. Cameras For 99% of users, the cameras are more than enough. The biggest advantage is using the high-quality rear cameras for selfies or streaming, which no standard phone—including the Ultra series—can match. Plus, when taking photos of others, they can preview themselves on the cover screen. Photos, selfies, and videos are sharp and vibrant. While professionals may prefer the S25 Ultra for advanced photography, the Fold’s versatility makes it an excellent choice for almost everyone. Final Thoughts The Z Fold 7 is an outstanding phone. Even if you’re coming from an Ultra, it only takes a few days to adjust before you realize you don’t miss the wider display. In fact, Ultras feel bulky and brick-like compared to the Fold, which is slimmer, more comfortable to hold, and far more versatile. The cover screen is fully usable for everyday apps, and when you want something larger, unfolding gives you a massive display that no traditional phone can match. I don’t regret switching at all—this is easily one of the best devices I’ve ever used, and I highly recommend it.",5.0,https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Smartphone-Unlocked-Manufacturer-Warranty/dp/B0F7K9LFCL/ref=sr_1_74?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.iBcSzgpkJScsrkfbMhxKA5CsbzbHxNE1s00VSqn7feu6vH1H1uYyS2S0c7osSQlwHMulp1s-poFk5c7ds4rqpivfgGlW_j5aHy7Nmou5vlG6n7DfPRLcSDp3f_p6m3FplWJAvpqA3qbbhtTkf8IgKJ1L_hZQ4I3l1EAvIaLAQ0MvyD_xQgUCS2_ZhX2X16ohJkp9CNQEgkkbwcN4JRD9QefbwdXkd439RVRL2CzglbrWD1uOkk-S1DEXBkE8Nbxu-gkw-RTsSZbZY8UbZ4MZGLWZOf4COecZBoGf5jVXUYw.rO0iqTh-Gar67tBCDR0IxVwBs79S8E397uKGkFyL9gs&dib_tag=se&qid=1769857440&refinements=p_123%3A46655&rnid=85457740011&s=wireless&sr=1-74&xpid=FEes0W8Q3djsz,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41yEZrL-vjL._AC_SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,Samsung,"Android 16, OneUI 8",12,Others,4.7,512,8.0,1968 x 2184,120,Galaxy Z Fold7,215.46,80%,4.5,en

I am upgrading from a 6 year old Samsung Galaxy (non-flagship) phone and the Z Flip 7 is the upgrade I needed! This is my first ""flip"" phone since my Motorola back in the 90s so this is definitely a new and exciting experience for me.

Functionality is premium and what you'd expect from a flagship Samsung device and the features seem never-ending. I've been with Samsung for most of my cellular life and couldn't be more pleased to have this unlocked beaut in my possession! If you're on the fence, take the leap and dive into the future of smartphones with the Galaxy Z Flip 7! Thanks to Amazon for providing me with the monthly pay option so I could be able to snag this gem before Christmas.

I've had their Galaxy Note, s2, s8, fold3 and now switched to the Flip 7. I loved the Fold3 but screen ended up not opening all the way and felt a bit heavy in the pockets. I needed something small and light. Amazon had a $200 gift card deal for flip 7 pre-orders, so that looked good to me. Once I got it, it's pretty good. Feels premium. The battery life is good. Durability is good so far. Time will tell if it holds up better than my fold3. I like using the smaller screen for games and browsing the web. It's also an easier way for me to view and change what I'm listening to rather than opening up the phone. Camera is good too. People get impressed when they see themselves on the selfie screen. I can't wait for the next version to make the outer screen like a regular smart phone instead of it currently relying on apps and widgets to be installed using big screen. Next version should also make the mini screen text friendly. I can send messages using it but it takes up the majority of the screen. Can't really see replies. One downside is that the connection drops. My mobile data symbol sometimes show a circle ⭕ with a line though it even when I'm in a good service area. Doesn't happen often though which is good. One of the functions I like is when I'm watching a YouTube video on the small screen, the volume up and down button get swapped, and works like it was intended. Volume down on big screen would be volume up when it's closed. I love that they thought of that. In the end, it's a great value for anyone looking for a minimal phone.",5.0,https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Smartphone-Unlocked-Manufacturer-Warranty/dp/B0F7K9LFCL/ref=sr_1_74?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.iBcSzgpkJScsrkfbMhxKA5CsbzbHxNE1s00VSqn7feu6vH1H1uYyS2S0c7osSQlwHMulp1s-poFk5c7ds4rqpivfgGlW_j5aHy7Nmou5vlG6n7DfPRLcSDp3f_p6m3FplWJAvpqA3qbbhtTkf8IgKJ1L_hZQ4I3l1EAvIaLAQ0MvyD_xQgUCS2_ZhX2X16ohJkp9CNQEgkkbwcN4JRD9QefbwdXkd439RVRL2CzglbrWD1uOkk-S1DEXBkE8Nbxu-gkw-RTsSZbZY8UbZ4MZGLWZOf4COecZBoGf5jVXUYw.rO0iqTh-Gar67tBCDR0IxVwBs79S8E397uKGkFyL9gs&dib_tag=se&qid=1769857440&refinements=p_123%3A46655&rnid=85457740011&s=wireless&sr=1-74&xpid=FEes0W8Q3djsz,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41yEZrL-vjL._AC_SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,Samsung,"Android 16, OneUI 8",12,Others,4.7,512,8.0,1968 x 2184,120,Galaxy Z Fold7,215.46,80%,4.5,en

Main display seems slightly frail, but I think it can still hold up with long term use. Bettery life seems better than expected. Durability factor will be tested more in the long term, but I got a great case for it I'm the meantime. It doesn't overheat as much under heavy use as some people said. The Exynos chipset is not slow at all and can definitely compete with other modern devices. It's no Snapdragon, but it's certainly quick and worth the money which is a pleasant surprise. The camera is totally fine. People are comparing it to the S25 Ultra camera or an iPhone pro camera when they need to compare it to a base model S25 or iPhone. It will suffice for most needs. It doesn't have ultra wideband. But that's something that most people won't notice or miss. The blue color is the absolute best and perfect. It's an eye catching color.

Unfolded to use tablet mode is a game changer. Don't get me wrong the price is steep but to be able to use my phone that functions as a tablet at work really helps pass the time. I've dropped it once and no damage so the durability is good so far. However its important to nose some paint has scratched off around the charge port. The paint around that area scratched off from my trying to insert the charger so be aware of that but to me personally is not a big deal. The phone is REALLY LIGHT. It weights about the same to my apple 13 mini iphone yet is much bigger and is about the same thickness UNFOLDED. Yet once you fold it into the tablet form its thinner then the iPhone 13 mini by a substantial amount. The color accuracy is pretty good. Trust me it doesn't get any better then this. Battery life lasts around 8-10 hours but I couldn't say for sure because I always play games on my phone so obviously its gonna drain battery more quickly but I personally am satisfied with how long it last. I bought the phone while on sale for $1699 which is still steep from the $2000. I can't get over the fact it can turn into a tablet.

Charging speed is really not great.  2 1/2 hours to fully charge.  My iPhone 16 Pro was far faster.  The big thing is to make sure you use a 25W charging block.  Just sticking it into any ol' charging block will end up much longer, most likely.  Yesterday, I was charging at 15W using a charging block with like 8 USB ports.  I didn't realize that 4 of those ports charge at only 5W.  Two others at 12 or 15W.  And two at 20W.  Going from 12/15W to 20W chopped 30 minutes off the charge time, which was 1 1/2 hours, at that point.  The phone will only charge up to 25W.  Other phones are 45 on up. 2)  Speakers kinda suck.  My iPhone 16 Pro was much better, and it wasn't great.  But... it's not that big a deal.  I'm not listening to anything that important on my phone. 3). Getting used to an Android phone again, after 6 years of an iPhone, (had Android since Android phones first came out), is it a bit of doing, but not that bad. 4).  The crease is not completely gone, but apparently much better than the Fold 6.  I'd like to see it gone completely, bu... it's really not an issue in real world use.  You don't really see it until turn the phone and catch some glare. 4).  I hate that I lose the ability to send text messages from my Mac's iMessage app.  This is truly the only REAL negative.  The other 4 above are minor.  But... I can use a free bit of software called Blue Bubble to allow me to do this.  I haven't set it up, yet, but... with working there's nothing to not recommend this awesome piece of tech.

The design is sleek, with a more durable hinge and a nearly flawless 7.6-inch display when unfolded.

Apps open in a flash, and running multiple apps side-by-side feels like a breeze.

Samsung's awful keyboard literally refuses to open on the front screen so frequently. -keyboard constaly suggests spelling for words that is incorrect. It will go out of its way to autocorrect words to be completely misplspelled. This keyboard is by far the worst of any phone company.

The screen works fine. I have had four Samsung flip phones. The ability to put it in your front pocket and still sit down is great. How easy it is to hold in your hand and not drop is great. The fact that you just flip it closed and it ends your session is great. The problem is that Samsung and to some extent Android in general have such horrible flaws. With speech to text, Samsung doesn't understand the exact commands they tell you they do. New line, new paragraph, Etc. As I remember, even if you say the word comma, it types that out instead of actually putting in the punctuation. Samsung was told about this by numerous people for the last 4 years or so and they've never addressed it. The result is that almost everybody uses gboard. Theoretically gboard is not as secure. Also, even if you're using gboard as your keyboard, Samsung doesn't allow you to remove theirs. It will capitalize odd words that are sometimes used as names. It will capitalize the first letter of a first name, but not the first letter of the last name that follows. As far as the flip phone goes, check things like resolution of the screen. You'll find that even the main screen is far below normal bar phone screens and even their own s25 Plus. So it's a mixed bag. If you don't use dictation it can probably be wonderful because of the form factor and because you get a very big screen when it's open. If you use dictation, forget about it.  I am switching to another phone. If Samsung and or Android we get there act together when it comes to dictation, I would stick with it.

I performed multiple factory resets, updated the phone fully, and used it normally. After a Samsung security/modem update, the phone suddenly lost service. When I tried to re-add my eSIM, the phone explicitly warned that the device is locked and activation failed. This is not a glitch — this is a carrier lock being enforced after updates. Yes, compatibility checkers may say this phone “works” on T-Mobile or Mint, but that is not the same thing as being unlocked. This phone was clearly still carrier-locked, and that only became obvious after normal use and required updates — something no buyer would reasonably expect.

I contacted T-Mobile directly and they confirmed only the *original owner* could unlock it, meaning this phone was not eligible for unlocking through any carrier support or service.

Usually, the ""FE"" designation just means the body of the phone is plastic rather than metal.  This phone works just as well as the S25 and will serve most users quite well. The 128 GB storage will hold thousands of pictures, etc. and all pictures and data can be transferred to one's computer if the memory should fill-up.  If you go to the two SIM card upgrade you will pay much more for the phone for not that much more ""bang for the buck"". Remember, this phone will work just fine for the MAJORITY of people who just want great calling, texting and photo abilities. The camera does a very nice job and is quite versatile.  You can do most everything you need for picture taking. One ""little"" problem however, you better know what you are doing if you plan to link/connect via bluetooth to your car hands-free system.  Connection takes ""patience"".  However, stick with it for once you do get connected the connection is very solid, clear and fast. If it would be helpful, my car is a 2024 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited with the UConnect-5 System in it.  It took a little bit of ""wrestling"" to get the connection made but it will eventually got through. The phone feels very good in the hand and it does have metal banding/edges all around it.  Definitely get a screen protector and some form of body case for added safety.  The phone works just fine with a screen protector on it because you can increase touch sensitivity through the phone settings. Take your time setting this phone up.  It has a ""thousand"" menus and selections that make the phone very personalized for each person.  Before doing the set up I would suggest you go online and look at many of the tutorials that are offered on set up and use. The phone is completely unlocked for ANY United States Carrier.  All you may need is a new SIM card to be sure you get the company services you want. These SIM cards can be obtained at the various carrier's stores--they cost about $10.00 and the technicians will install them for you.  These phones WILL allow you to use the new eSIM card set-ups also. I would recommend purchase of this Samsung S25FE phone for certain!

I never really used them for more than texting and phone calls. Then came 2FA and apps for everything. I have always liked Samsung phones, I was ready for a new device and this time I decided to look at the top tier devices during the sales. NEVER APPLE or ONE PLUS so would be Pixel 10 Pro or S25 Ultra. Bought both... Usually I spent $150 -$200 and they get the job done so I was sceptical on spending $1K on a phone. The Pixel was ok, though not worth it over what I already had. Then the Samsung S25 Ultra arrived (with a free bundled set or Pro 3 Ear Buds) and all I can say is Wow! This thing is built like a tank, super quality construction. Love the material, screen OLED is amazing, camera is outstanding and the audio synced with the Pro 3 Buds is unreal. Put Spotify on and I hear thing in songs I have never heard before, the clarity and frequency response is like nothing I have ever heard before. I love Samsung because you can customize almost everything about this phone, they don't load it with bloat, and they make it easy to disable features if you don't want them, unlike some other brands. I run mine pretty lean without a lot of background stuff going and the battery charge lasts longer than any other phone I have had. I did not expect that at all. And it charges fast.

Cameras have been great. Software is best in class, s pen is handy for quick notes. I do have some feedback for samsung though, some of these are nitpicks but I do wanna bring those up. - Camera is great for my usage but it would be great if the array of cameras was in a horizontal visor akin to the pixel -OIS on the space zoom camera. Sometimes I use my phone like binoculars when hiking and wanna snap a quick pic. Also maybe copy some ideas from apple like the camera button, the magnetic sensor shift stabilization, and square sensor. - More ram would be appreciated, 12gb is no slouch and I have no doubts it won't be a painpoint but competitors like google have it albeit with a much weaker chip. It's not that the phone isn't future proof, it's more that there could be more to be done. That being said the RAM shortage is surely gonna keep 12gb the standard for the foreseeable. future. -PLEASE KEEP THE SPEN. I don't care for bluetooth functionality but other people do. I just like it for quick notes and using it like a mouse. Honestly I wouldn't consider this phone if it didn't have it. -Silicon carbon battery? Now the battery has been able to last me a full day with the light performance profile, 1080p resolution, mostly on wifi, 6-9 hours of SoT depending what I'm doing. I do understand the US has some regulations on battery capacity and samsung might still have ptsd from the note 7, but companies like oneplus have it. Yes they do age faster then conventional batteries but even so, an aged silicon carbon battery can still have better battery than a conventional lithium ion. -I don't really play games on my phone, mostly use my steamdeck for that but I'm just gonna throw this out there... a sprititual successor to the xperia play would make me so happy. -Samsung I love oneui but please stop making duplicate apps for everything. It's a minor annoyance since you can uninstall/hide everything but come on don't be annoying. -speech to type is better on the pixel from what I've read online -maybe support the aptx adaptive and aptx hd bluetooth codecs -Bring gemini to android auto. Now I'm not a big ai user I turn off most everything except gemini and circle to search, I think it's obnoxiously implemented but google assistant is just plain stupid when using android auto. Also while on the topic of gemini, I want to be able to tell gemini ""play *song* by *artist* and it not be limited to youtube music and spotify. I wanna use other services like deezer or my locally downloaded music. -front facing speakers. I appreciate the stereospeakers but how cool would it be if we had both speakers front facing? -finally please implement a ""hold for me"" and call tree like pixels do. I know it sounds like I'm just envying pixel software feature but that would seriously be game over. Phone trees seems to be brain numbing nowadays and hold music is a form of torture.",5.0,https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Smartphone-Unlocked-Res-Camera-Warranty/dp/B0FG1THCD7/ref=sr_1_5?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.IZthQETfgZ_94BMyZ4wxCZDSyykL3KflyE0J2qS9upHAUT_kwVjHlm79K9ZxYvKjpgZfvsrYtiiGnsUjuzAB8utTTWaPqFi31VL8gRCeq9VdrMUtIt9FXmShfw7jCOOnDUNa6fVJdPeeRhtPhZojc-CCDGdmcSLITd4dNNnsZcsC2k-ZEk1IjSTwBBATiW2Mj3w2mWUxNlbf9wlUK9-XR_Z7l80cwYoEXS0F_65Lf-iBXi8AETMpkPoxqPKKYuPWz9jrtD2viwzNYc82EdkA9I6SgMPwrfYtvAJrEwJXXRs.hTQzOK4_ECLs3fIneUVQ6FUlrl5YKDlfRhbTRABnc9w&dib_tag=se&qid=1769857411&refinements=p_123%3A46655&rnid=85457740011&s=wireless&sr=1-5&xpid=FPUY1SF7P-F1N,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Q0M3d7QdL._AC_SY300_SX300_QL70_ML2_.jpg,Samsung,"Android 16.0, One UI 8",8,Exynos 2400 S5E9945,2.2,256,6.7,2340 x 1080,120,Galaxy S25 FE,189.95,82%,4.6,en

Not only cheaper than if I got thru my carrier locally, but it's unlocked so I can switch off I want to.  IT ALSO CAME WITH A PROMO OF DBL STORAGE FOR FREE AND A 100 AMAZON GC!!! Why I like this phone.  LITERALLY took 5 minds to set up and transfer all my contacts and apps and set up on with my carrier. It is much lighter than my old Samsung 36. IT IS spec wise so close to the samsung s25. It is so fast with built in AI features which are fun and helpful. Overall if you are an android user this phone feels and acts like the phones that are 1200$ on up. I also like the changes.  It has great sound, great""cleaner"" on the phone,  gorilla glass screen, and the fingerprint unlock feature is no longer the power button but on the screen. I learned long ago, even if you are super excited to start using the phone, be sure you charge it to 100% on the first charge.  Then go to settings, battery , and set it to never over charge.  OLD PHONE defaulted to cap at 85%, this one let's you set the top up to 95%. I used to have an electric vehicle and the batteries need to learn what 100 is but never overcharge.  This will extend the life of the phone and prevent major headaches in the future.  I keep mine on the charger overnight and playing my favorite sleep podcast- it stops at 95% and does not get hot. I am always playing audible books or podcasts and using Google maps.  The battery stays charged and by the end of the day it's around 70%. I am thankful samsung put out a good ""lower priced model"" than the s25 ultra. I also ran into using 99% of my storage on my old phone(128gb) I have every kind of app on here and it's only using 28% of my total storage so I highly recommend getting the 512 GB of you need lots of room. I am one of those people that keeps a phone forever and I think this one will last me a very long time.",5.0,https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Smartphone-Unlocked-Res-Camera-Warranty/dp/B0FG1THCD7/ref=sr_1_5?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.IZthQETfgZ_94BMyZ4wxCZDSyykL3KflyE0J2qS9upHAUT_kwVjHlm79K9ZxYvKjpgZfvsrYtiiGnsUjuzAB8utTTWaPqFi31VL8gRCeq9VdrMUtIt9FXmShfw7jCOOnDUNa6fVJdPeeRhtPhZojc-CCDGdmcSLITd4dNNnsZcsC2k-ZEk1IjSTwBBATiW2Mj3w2mWUxNlbf9wlUK9-XR_Z7l80cwYoEXS0F_65Lf-iBXi8AETMpkPoxqPKKYuPWz9jrtD2viwzNYc82EdkA9I6SgMPwrfYtvAJrEwJXXRs.hTQzOK4_ECLs3fIneUVQ6FUlrl5YKDlfRhbTRABnc9w&dib_tag=se&qid=1769857411&refinements=p_123%3A46655&rnid=85457740011&s=wireless&sr=1-5&xpid=FPUY1SF7P-F1N,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Q0M3d7QdL._AC_SY300_SX300_QL70_ML2_.jpg,Samsung,"Android 16.0, One UI 8",8,Exynos 2400 S5E9945,2.2,256,6.7,2340 x 1080,120,Galaxy S25 FE,189.95,82%,4.6,en

I thought I would miss the option of having a micro SD slot however the 256GB is actually plenty, I'm storing over several thousand images and 4K videos and still only 1/3 full. The phone dimensions are similar to most flagship models on the market but the S25 is noticeably heavy and still tough to carry in your pants pocket, can be difficult to remove depending on what your wearing and if your sitting. The phone feels stronger however I use a case to protect it, makes is easier to hold and protects it from drops. I don't use screen protectors and so far after several months of daily carrying in pockets, taking to the beach and covered in sand, and carrying around the yard while working, I still haven't noticed any scratches on the screen or camera lenses. The new AI features are helpful and can be fun, Samsung has their own AI apps and so far the drawing assist is my favorite, some of the apps work best with a pen and the one included with the phone is actually very good. I didn't think I'd ever use it and was planning to hold on buying a new phone until the next model arrives, if they offered an Ultra without a pen, but I'm glad I got this one. It's also great if your hands are dirty and you don't want to touch the screen, it doesn't have any remote options for taking pictures but still works very well for most tasks. The cameras are amazing, vibrant images and taking pictures at night actually works. It does a good job of not overexposing lights in the background and clearly capturing the subject in front. The AI clears up a lot of the ghosting effect you get when the subject moves and the phone is set to a long exposure time. I'm glad I'm finally able to capture family moments when there's insufficient lighting, missed a lot of good opportunities with the last phone.

I got it for $534 USD during Early Black Friday Deals on Amazon. I must say this phone feels premium in my had. Wonderfully made. Slick and nice. Not too big and not too small.  The back feels really good without the case. The phone feels light in my hand. But I use cases for my devices so that nice touch feeling goes away once i have on the phone case.  I took the Jet Black colour as I find it the nicest and best colour. The phone is lighter than my old phone. A Wonderful 7.9 "" display. I use my phone for Light gaming like Subway Surf, Lords Mobile, so the Exynos 2400 Should be good enough for me.  I also took the 256 GB storage because I like taking pictures and saving  Videos on my phone. The camera ... I must say ""WOW"" coming from the A71. It is too good to be true. It picks up a lot of details. The video is another  ""WOW"". One thing I have noticed is that the phone started heating up during the set up. So  I you are looking to do lots with this phone maybe go for the S25 or higher. I just got this phone because my old phone has numerous lines on the screen and I wanted something with bigger storage and better camera and at least 4 years of updates. This S25 FE gives 7 years worth of updates so good enough for me since my phones last me a  minimum 4 years. At the back of the phone in the images you may not see the silver rings around camera because I put on a screen protector thing for the camera but i might take it off because I love seeing the silver rings.

I’ve been using this phone for about two months now, and it just feels like a power tool in my pocket—in the best way possible. Let’s start with the obvious: the screen. It’s absolutely stunning. The flat display is a GAME-CHANGER. No more accidental touches, and applying screen protectors is finally a stress-free experience. The brightness is insane; I can read everything perfectly clear under direct sunlight. Watching videos and scrolling is just buttery smooth. The camera system is next-level, especially for zoom. The 5x optical zoom lens is the real deal. I took a photo of the moon (yes, I became that person) and the details were incredible. But it’s not just a party trick. I used the 10x zoom at my kid's soccer game and could actually see faces clearly from the bleachers. The 200MP main sensor captures crazy detail if you have good light, and the low-light photos are far cleaner than on my old phone. The AI editing tools are also surprisingly useful for quickly removing photobombers or shadows. Performance is flawless. Everything is instant, apps launch fast, switching between them is seamless, and gaming is super smooth. The battery life is a marathon runner. I’m a heavy user (emails, social media, YouTube, some gaming), and I easily get through a full day with 20-30% to spare. The S-Pen is as handy as ever for quick notes and edits. I was worried about the titanium build and boxy design being uncomfortable, but it feels premium and solid in the hand. The matte finish doesn’t pick up fingerprints, which is a huge win. Is it perfect? It’s a big, heavy phone—no getting around that. And it’s expensive. You’re paying for the absolute top of the line. But if you want the maximum possible from a smartphone right now, this is it. Pros: Gorgeous flat display, unbeatable zoom camera, all-day+ battery life, blazing fast performance, useful S-Pen, premium titanium build. Cons:Large and heavy (not for everyone), very high price tag. Verdict:9.5/10. It’s the ultimate do-everything smartphone. If you’re a power user, a creative, or just want the best camera system on the market, this phone is worth every penny.

The display is bright, sharp, and smooth, making everything from doom-scrolling to spreadsheets look unfairly good. The 256GB storage is perfect for heavy app users and photo hoarders like me — plenty of space, zero cloud-panicked storage math. Performance-wise, this phone is a multitasking ninja. I run work apps, streaming, navigation, and background downloads, and it handles everything without drama, lag, or turning into a pocket heater. The AI features genuinely help too — smart photo enhancement, writing suggestions, and adaptive system tweaks that make everyday use feel faster and more intuitive. The unlocked flexibility is a huge bonus — carrier switching, travel SIMs, or no SIM at all, it just works. Battery life? Solid. It gets me through the day with space to spare, even with heavier 5G and app usage. ✅ Pros: ✔ Fast and smooth performance for daily tasks ✔ AI features are actually useful (not salesperson poetry) ✔ 256GB storage = generous and practical ✔ Slim, modern FE design looks premium ✔ Handles 5G and accessories reliably ✔ Unlocked freedom is clutch ✔ No bloat-feeling slowdown so far ⚠ Cons / Tips: • Not the absolute top-tier S line — but honestly, unless you stare at spec sheets for sport, you’ll never feel like you compromised. • Pair with a good USB-C GaN Charger if you want maximum fast-charging efficiency. • Because it’s FE-light and sleek, consider a grippy magnetic case if you like snap-on accessories. Bottom line: If you want a phone that delivers flagship thinking, amazing everyday performance, and smart storage value — without flagship pricing guilt, this is your 2025 sweet spot. The S25 FE earns 5 stars not because it’s “affordable”… but because it never makes you think about the word affordable at all. 😎📱⚡💡👏",5.0,https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Smartphone-Unlocked-Res-Camera-Warranty/dp/B0FG1THCD7/ref=sr_1_5?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.IZthQETfgZ_94BMyZ4wxCZDSyykL3KflyE0J2qS9upHAUT_kwVjHlm79K9ZxYvKjpgZfvsrYtiiGnsUjuzAB8utTTWaPqFi31VL8gRCeq9VdrMUtIt9FXmShfw7jCOOnDUNa6fVJdPeeRhtPhZojc-CCDGdmcSLITd4dNNnsZcsC2k-ZEk1IjSTwBBATiW2Mj3w2mWUxNlbf9wlUK9-XR_Z7l80cwYoEXS0F_65Lf-iBXi8AETMpkPoxqPKKYuPWz9jrtD2viwzNYc82EdkA9I6SgMPwrfYtvAJrEwJXXRs.hTQzOK4_ECLs3fIneUVQ6FUlrl5YKDlfRhbTRABnc9w&dib_tag=se&qid=1769857411&refinements=p_123%3A46655&rnid=85457740011&s=wireless&sr=1-5&xpid=FPUY1SF7P-F1N,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Q0M3d7QdL._AC_SY300_SX300_QL70_ML2_.jpg,Samsung,"Android 16.0, One UI 8",8,Exynos 2400 S5E9945,2.2,256,6.7,2340 x 1080,120,Galaxy S25 FE,189.95,82%,4.6,en

The screen is beautiful, the speakers are loud and clear, and the camera takes great photos. Cell service and internet connectivity have been solid and reliable with no complaints. When I first purchased the phone, the battery life was outstanding—easily close to two full days and comparable to the iPhone 16 Pro Max. Unfortunately, after being forced to install software updates, that battery performance dropped noticeably. What was once amazing is now just decent, with the phone ending a full day around 16% battery, even though I limit charging to 85% to preserve long-term battery health. This feels more like a software optimization issue than a hardware problem, which is disappointing. Bixby and Samsung’s built-in ecosystem are underwhelming to me, but Google’s Assistant AI works very well, and if you don’t like either option, using ChatGPT is a solid alternative. The S Pen is a nice added bonus and genuinely useful at times. The phone itself feels durable, though I still recommend using a case for extra protection. I purchased a new phone and received a new phone and perfect condition. I also haven’t experienced any screen burn-in issues, even with the always-on display enabled. Overall, it’s a powerful and premium device with excellent features, but software updates and battery regression keep it from being a top-tier experience.",4.0,https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Smartphone-Unlocked-Res-Camera-Warranty/dp/B0FG1THCD7/ref=sr_1_5?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.IZthQETfgZ_94BMyZ4wxCZDSyykL3KflyE0J2qS9upHAUT_kwVjHlm79K9ZxYvKjpgZfvsrYtiiGnsUjuzAB8utTTWaPqFi31VL8gRCeq9VdrMUtIt9FXmShfw7jCOOnDUNa6fVJdPeeRhtPhZojc-CCDGdmcSLITd4dNNnsZcsC2k-ZEk1IjSTwBBATiW2Mj3w2mWUxNlbf9wlUK9-XR_Z7l80cwYoEXS0F_65Lf-iBXi8AETMpkPoxqPKKYuPWz9jrtD2viwzNYc82EdkA9I6SgMPwrfYtvAJrEwJXXRs.hTQzOK4_ECLs3fIneUVQ6FUlrl5YKDlfRhbTRABnc9w&dib_tag=se&qid=1769857411&refinements=p_123%3A46655&rnid=85457740011&s=wireless&sr=1-5&xpid=FPUY1SF7P-F1N,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Q0M3d7QdL._AC_SY300_SX300_QL70_ML2_.jpg,Samsung,"Android 16.0, One UI 8",8,Exynos 2400 S5E9945,2.2,256,6.7,2340 x 1080,120,Galaxy S25 FE,189.95,8%,4.6,en

Coming from an old iphone that has been saying I am tired, everything feels amazing. However, I do have an iphone 15 pro and have used 17 briefly, so I will compare them if you are having to decide between them: Camera: 15 pro has an overall a bit better camera system, pronounced more with indoor shots and low light situations. S25 seems to prioritize faster shutter over better light capture and it can gather less light, limiting its photo quality at low light. At other situations, there is no noticeable quality difference. 17 has a better low light performance as well, but lacks the telephoto lens. The biggest win for S25 camera is the telephoto in my opinion, and it is amazing for professional looking outdoor shots. I may be overusing it during my trips but it has been a game changer for me. pro iphones have the same lens, but they are a lot more pricey. It is a privilege at this price point. The official expert raw app from Samsung gives you a bit more edge over iphones, but it is not enough to compensate for the inferior sensor during point and shoot scenarios. May be a different story if you got time and the skills to use it. Material feel: the aluminum and glass body is iphone like, and it is great to see the phone industry caught up with apple on this. I like the iphone roundness a bit more aestetically pleasing, but my eyes got used to it too. Unlocking: faceID works fine mostly during the day but struggles at night, unlike iphones that can do it at any condition. The fingerprint is my most go to method, but finding where the sensor is sometimes a hit or miss. I drew lines on the case to find it more easily. Also, the accuracy drops a bit further with a glass screen protector and most protectors have the fingerprint accuracy drop as feedback on their pages. I wish I knew this before. Still searching for that amazing screen protector. Screen: 120 hz smoothness has been there for a long time, but my first experience with it now on the android side and 60hz feels yuck at this point. Can't go back. Both 17 and 15 pro has the feature, so no longer a deciding factor, but I am glad to see Apple finally giving that to everyone with 17. Too late for me though. I lost FaceTime and the blue bubbles (or green, I don't remember what color it was), and it has been alright. I am using WhatsApp video calls instead, and I admit that the video quality seems to be noticeably worse, but I got used to it all. The lines are more blurry with imessage, as RCS on the new androids allow for the most of that bubbles privileges. One more loss was airdrop, which I used to use a lot sending photos, but now I just use a usb cable between phones and grab from the iphone using the files manager. I am rooting for a handshake between Google and Apple someday that they will lower the walls. I tried a few third party apps that replace airdrop, but none was ok. On the other hand, finally I can transfer all my photos to my PC at once, by just plugging it! A feature that iphones lack. Tried getting all the photos to backup with the iphone and it fails no matter what I tried. I speculate that they are pushing icloud onto us and japordizing all the other methods for backing up photos, so the exit is here. Just get a phone that doesn't force you to their cloud service (hint: this one). The UI: can be set up like iphone by selecting ""gestures"", but the classic back button layout is more intuitive and the gestures mode seems less polished. A good alternative especially if you swear by the iphone way to interact with your phone. Payment: Apple pay has to strong contenders here: Google Pay and Samsung Pay. Both are very strong but I ended up with Google pay as it is more widely used. From pizza apps to banking, almost all the apps that I used to use Apple pay with just works with Google Pay. Battery life: not noticeably different from 15 pro or 17. 17 has a bit more juice even though it has lower battery capacity, but the difference between this or the others is something I could not tell during my use. The least I can say is that it should not be a deciding factor. Weight and size: feels significantly lighter than the pro Iphones and a bit lighter than the regular. A blindfolded person can easily tell the difference and holding iphones feel heavy to me now. Can't get smaller phones anymore, but hats off to Samsung for sticking with the lightness at least! Overall, a bit better point and shoot camera is not enough to justify that extra for me and I like the flexibility that android gives to this phone. The iphones and this are way too similar than I imagined before getting it, so the switch (both ways) is a lot easier now than ever. I am very happy with the phone and if you are on the fence, I would say just give it a try, please? Update: I found out amfilm screen protector that is made of hard glass and is very thin, so it does not reduce fingerprint accuracy. I totally forgot it was an annoyance. Plus, using the night mode on the camera for any indoor shots give me similar quality shots to the iphone because it tends to increase the shutter time. Turns out the iphone does it without the night mode and it was the secret sauce to better night time pictures. Now I use the Samsung camera more confidently!",4.0,https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Smartphone-Unlocked-Res-Camera-Warranty/dp/B0FG1THCD7/ref=sr_1_5?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.IZthQETfgZ_94BMyZ4wxCZDSyykL3KflyE0J2qS9upHAUT_kwVjHlm79K9ZxYvKjpgZfvsrYtiiGnsUjuzAB8utTTWaPqFi31VL8gRCeq9VdrMUtIt9FXmShfw7jCOOnDUNa6fVJdPeeRhtPhZojc-CCDGdmcSLITd4dNNnsZcsC2k-ZEk1IjSTwBBATiW2Mj3w2mWUxNlbf9wlUK9-XR_Z7l80cwYoEXS0F_65Lf-iBXi8AETMpkPoxqPKKYuPWz9jrtD2viwzNYc82EdkA9I6SgMPwrfYtvAJrEwJXXRs.hTQzOK4_ECLs3fIneUVQ6FUlrl5YKDlfRhbTRABnc9w&dib_tag=se&qid=1769857411&refinements=p_123%3A46655&rnid=85457740011&s=wireless&sr=1-5&xpid=FPUY1SF7P-F1N,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Q0M3d7QdL._AC_SY300_SX300_QL70_ML2_.jpg,Samsung,"Android 16.0, One UI 8",8,Exynos 2400 S5E9945,2.2,256,6.7,2340 x 1080,120,Galaxy S25 FE,189.95,8%,4.6,en

I did have some problems initially connecting it to spectrum. It turned out I THINK that the mobile data was turned off in the settings somewhere and I have no idea why. I got it on sale for about 1K and it was normally 1500 as it is the 512GB version. I absolutely hate the fact no major cell phone carriers have sd cards anymore. I want to not have to worry about space for my photos.  I purchased a third party screen protector as I did not want to chance my screen being scratched as well as a battery case which keeps the phone charged over Wireless power delivery so I have full access to the USB port for things like video output. I was coming from a note 10 plus 4g version so this is a big upgrade and I plan to hold on to this phone for another 5 years or so. I upgraded only because certain apps would not support my old android version but the old phone was plenty good. (Oh also my external battery pack died and I couldn't get another one anymore). I do like that they ditched the curved glass as I hated that. They also ditched the backside glass which I hated even more!  Sound Quality is far better than my note 10. It comes out of a slit at the bottom. Initially I did not know what it was. The fit is great as it is almost exactly the same size as my note 10. I would have loved it if they made a more of 8 inch tablet phone but nope. Value for money is so so. I do not like spending 1k for a cell phone especially when it was on sale. It is the same price as a full blown computer but at least on a computer I can put extra storage. I do like the face recognition and the finger print works from behind the glass screen protector. I do wish the S Pen retention was better as I have already lost mine after the phone fell off a shelf. Thank god for the battery case and the screen protector. If they had an SD card I would have purchased a model with less memory. It is just Samsung causing us to pay extra especially since the flash chips are not that expensive and the assembly process is exactly the same.,4.0,https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Smartphone-Unlocked-Res-Camera-Warranty/dp/B0FG1THCD7/ref=sr_1_5?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.IZthQETfgZ_94BMyZ4wxCZDSyykL3KflyE0J2qS9upHAUT_kwVjHlm79K9ZxYvKjpgZfvsrYtiiGnsUjuzAB8utTTWaPqFi31VL8gRCeq9VdrMUtIt9FXmShfw7jCOOnDUNa6fVJdPeeRhtPhZojc-CCDGdmcSLITd4dNNnsZcsC2k-ZEk1IjSTwBBATiW2Mj3w2mWUxNlbf9wlUK9-XR_Z7l80cwYoEXS0F_65Lf-iBXi8AETMpkPoxqPKKYuPWz9jrtD2viwzNYc82EdkA9I6SgMPwrfYtvAJrEwJXXRs.hTQzOK4_ECLs3fIneUVQ6FUlrl5YKDlfRhbTRABnc9w&dib_tag=se&qid=1769857411&refinements=p_123%3A46655&rnid=85457740011&s=wireless&sr=1-5&xpid=FPUY1SF7P-F1N,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Q0M3d7QdL._AC_SY300_SX300_QL70_ML2_.jpg,Samsung,"Android 16.0, One UI 8",8,Exynos 2400 S5E9945,2.2,256,6.7,2340 x 1080,120,Galaxy S25 FE,189.95,8%,4.6,en

Remember when you did a search and you could actually do research. Well those days are gone. Now the only answer you get is what AI wants you to get, You can put your brain in a safe deposit box as free will and actually thinking are a thing of the past. I get AI when places are actually to cheap to pay for people. They have gone way to far. No longer are you shown how to think. Now it is all about what to think.

Installing and transferring over my apps and data was very easy with the included transfer app. Just make sure to connect both to wifi and let the transfer app update first before trying it. Popped in my old SIM card and it recognized it instantly as expected since this is an unlocked phone. What wasn't expected though was the lack of a microSD slot. Pretty disappointing. Speed is very fast, though the animations are still annoyingly slow. Ended up going into developer options and turning animation speed to 2X and now it just flies and everything is almost instant. As big as it is, I still needed a case for it to protect it, and got one of those plastic inner with silicone cover type cases. Fit very well and made it even bigger and heftier, but such is the cost of wanting to use modern phones. Feels fine though and can still fit into my pocket. Battery life is great. With how fast the phone is I can set it to power save mode and it's still miles ahead of my old S9. And it has a new feature to keep the battery capped at 80%. This prevents the battery from wearing out over time when left on a charger at 100%. You'll have less battery in the short term, but your battery will last years longer before it degrades. The AI photo fixing tools are amazing. Actually went back through a lot of old photos from my S9 that were messed up and didn't have any retakes, and the S25U was able to fix up all of them perfectly.

The phone is quite heavy. The battery life despite promises is not very impressive. With normal use it lasts approximately 36 hours, but if camera is used, particularly with high resolution, the battery will drain very fast since the phone heats up very badly. The screen quality is very good, especially no glare feature. I would definitely give it five stars if not a major problem. After a day of use the left part of the screen stopped responding to two finger pinching gesture for zomming in and out. It is happening with any application allowing zooming, such as Gallery, browsers, Photos, to name but a few. After a reboot it would work for a few hours, and will start again. I initiated a return with Amazon, and since Amazon wouldn't deliver a replacement on time for the return to be sent back, I purchased another one from Best Buy. And... absolutely same issue. Now both will go back because this is an absolutely unacceptable problem. Another problem that is annoying, but not critical. The sound volume jumps up and down when switching between apps. For example you are on a speaker in WhatsApp, you pick a regular phone call and switch back, the volume may jump to its maximum, or you increase the volume for phone conversation, it will also increase the ring tone volume.

I use Adobe products like Photoshop. I was hoping to have a high quality camera on me at all times for photographing unplanned scenes and subjects (i.o.w. when I'm not lugging around my heavy Canon dslr and lenses). The jpegs this phone produces look fine in my Adobe products, (appear consistent with Samsung's Gallery app) and are acceptable quality for medium-sized prints, let's say 11x14. But for $1000+ I want the raw photos Samsung claims this phone can take. Once the photos get imported into Adobe apps, whether a mobile or desktop, it becomes apparent that the raw images are not really raw - they act like jpegs with a raw file ending. (I learned from researching, other users have found some third party apps can output the real raw images but those apps don't have access to all the camera hardware features. I did not feel this was an acceptable solution for such an expensive phone). Additionally the raw images appear terrible compared to their jpeg counterparts; they're extremely overexposed with odd color artifacts and pixelization, unusable as shot.

On day 1, the day before the Otterbox case I ordered from Amazon arrived, I was walking my dog, she saw a rabbit and bolted. This caused me to accidently drop the phone from hip height (less than 36"") on to the sidewalk. It landed on its back, and a small u-shaped crack developed on the back glass. I did not realize the back was constructed of such flimsy glass.  This experience is contrary to the drop tests I reviewed before buying the phone, and I expected higher durability from Samsung. I'd have gladly accepted a more durable plastic back like some of the A series phones have.  Needless to say, it went in the Otterbox as soon as it came a day later.  I decided to live with the crack, as it was barely visible when in the case. About 3 weeks after purchase (July 2), I look at the back of my phone and see that the crack has now grown diagonally across the back of the back of the phone (see attached photo). Probably due to thermal contraction and expansion due to Maryland summers and the fact that my life does not allow me to stay in a constant temperature and humidity controlled environment. I decided to file a complaint with Samsung.  I got referred to a repair shop, who contacted me promptly to tell me that the repair would be out of pocket (roughly $130) unless I had Samsung care or something through my phone carrier. I am on the fence about doing this, but leaning towards doing it, especially if I decide not to keep this phone. Yesterday, I used the phone to take photos at the local 4th of July parade. Ambient temperature was about 84 degrees F. After about an hour of intermittent camera use, the phone became too hot to operate and handle. This is simply unacceptable! I have also found that the battery life claims are highly optimistic and not indicative of real world use. I am fortunate if I can get a full waking day (16 hours) from 100% to 15% (connect charger), and less if I am using the phone more extensively. I was forced to upgrade to this phone from my S20 FE since Samsung ceased to support the S20 series in May 2025. I am seriously considering either going back to that phone or replacing this one with either an A series or even an iPhone. Buyer beware! Your user experience with this phone may vary. I have been a loyal Samsung customer since the Galaxy S3, but that may change since my experience with this phone has been a bitter disappointment.",1.0,https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Smartphone-Unlocked-Res-Camera-Warranty/dp/B0FG1THCD7/ref=sr_1_5?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.IZthQETfgZ_94BMyZ4wxCZDSyykL3KflyE0J2qS9upHAUT_kwVjHlm79K9ZxYvKjpgZfvsrYtiiGnsUjuzAB8utTTWaPqFi31VL8gRCeq9VdrMUtIt9FXmShfw7jCOOnDUNa6fVJdPeeRhtPhZojc-CCDGdmcSLITd4dNNnsZcsC2k-ZEk1IjSTwBBATiW2Mj3w2mWUxNlbf9wlUK9-XR_Z7l80cwYoEXS0F_65Lf-iBXi8AETMpkPoxqPKKYuPWz9jrtD2viwzNYc82EdkA9I6SgMPwrfYtvAJrEwJXXRs.hTQzOK4_ECLs3fIneUVQ6FUlrl5YKDlfRhbTRABnc9w&dib_tag=se&qid=1769857411&refinements=p_123%3A46655&rnid=85457740011&s=wireless&sr=1-5&xpid=FPUY1SF7P-F1N,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Q0M3d7QdL._AC_SY300_SX300_QL70_ML2_.jpg,Samsung,"Android 16.0, One UI 8",8,Exynos 2400 S5E9945,2.2,256,6.7,2340 x 1080,120,Galaxy S25 FE,189.95,6%,4.6,en

I ordered MINT green. The picture shows ""MINT"" green. The box they shipped it in says MINT green. The settings on the phone says ""MINT"" green. So instead of a nice, cheerful, spring green phone I would enjoy looking at, why did they send me a COAL ASH AIR POLLUTION GREY PHONE that is so smoky and dark I have to try to hide it in a case?! This is blatant false advertising. The product they sell you looks nothing like the false mockup picture they made up for the listing. I have asked everyone I know and no one thinks it's a MINT PHONE. It's GREY. Not only that, the whole experience has been downhill from there as I've lost a lot of the features and freedom I took for granted on my S10. I'm afraid to even use the flashlight because it gets so hot it burns. When I first turned it on I got a warning alert that it can cause skin burns. Can you imagine if the other brand tried to sell a phone with a flashlight that burns through plastic and causes skin burns so much they have to put a warning alert when it's toggled on? Games that played effortlessly on my Samsung Galaxy S10 overheat this S25, freeze, don't respond, or just don't run at all. I have a huge list of issues with this phone and I will never buy another Samsung product again.

Couldn't wait to start using it as I've heard such great things about it. Started moving files thru the Smart Switch app and it moved all of my files from one phone to the other using the cable method. Only to about 6 hours to move all of them. After the move, I was moving my music around to different playlists and went to play music and noticed that some of it wasn't playing. I thought maybe the file transfer was corrupted somehow so I deleted the music file off the phone. This time I downloaded just the music file thru the Smart Switch App again and this time and it only took 3 hours.  Went to play music and just as before half of the music wouldn't play. Went online to ask what the problem was or was I doing something wrong. I found out SAMSUNG NO LONGER SUPPORTS WMA FILES, THIS SUCKS!!!  I have an extensive CD collection that I like to move songs onto my phone so that I can listen to them while I'm away from home.  It's unfortunate the Samsung folks spent so much time and effort on upgrades to their phone that they eliminated the one function I use the most. Contacted the Samsung forum about the issue and Samsung's response for a solution to THEIR problem was to look for a third party app that may be able to solve it, however no suggestions given.  I have been a proponent of Samsung for many years ditching my Apple phone long ago because Samsung was so much better (except their Icemakers).

This is a very weak device. Terrible functionality. When I purchased this product I was moving to another town and I was very busy, therefore I did not have time to use it. So I missed the deadline to return it back to Amazon.  Be aware that Samsung only accepts returns upto 14 days. This device randomly freezes, to the point that you click on one app either does not open it at all, or you click on gmail suddenly it opens your instagram. Or you click on google map suddenly opens WhatsApp. It is a terrible experience since I paid above 1000 to make sure to buy a phone that I do not have this experience, but the phone feels like a useless toy in hand. I also called samsung customer service and they refuse to take it back even when their device does not work and it is only 40 days passed from purchase. I rarely write reviews, but this time I am writing to make people aware, you pay above 1000 but feels as cheap as 100 phone. Do not do that to yourself.

I did, they confirmed that it was a camera module failure & I hadn't damaged it (the rear-facing cameras work fine). However, since the camera is so new, there are no selfie camera modules available, so they told me to contact Samsung again.

If it were possible to install LineageOS or some alternate firmware then I might be using it for that purpose. However, it seems that's not possible. Some reasons why I want to install alternate firmware include: 1) I do not like the Samsung UI 2) I want to log in as root, change OS settings, run SQL statements on sqlite databases for apps, etc. 3) have the option to make changes to Android, compile those changes and flash those changes to my device. Since as I previously stated that is not possible, I am now using this device as a home router by enabling the wireless ""hotspot"" feature. Here are the things I like: 1) Good hardware. The upload and download speeds are significantly faster compared to iPhone 15 Pro Max. Things I do not like: 1) The lowest battery charge setting is 80%. Since this is plugged in all the time, I'd like to set this to 50%. 2) This is connecting my EightSleep mattress to the internet (the mattress doesn't work unless connected to the internet). One issue I have is that the Samsung S25+ will automatically install updates and reboot. And when it reboots, my EightSleep mattress is then disconnected from the internet and I cannot control it and I loose all sleep data for that day. 3) And finally, this is what I dislike the most: when there are no devices connected to the hotspot, it will automatically turn off.

I purchased this phone February when it just came out. 3 months ago I started having issues with the volume. It would go up and down by itself. It also would mute itself and I would be missing parts of a conversation  when talking. I have a one year warranty on the phone. I called Amazon because this is where I purchased it from. Well Lord and behold  Samsung tells me they do not replace phones outside of 15 days. They stated I would need to call Amazon because that is where I bought it from. Well Amazon has stated they will not replace the phone because it is outside of the 30 days. Well Amazon will end up being in another law suite because that is not what is stated on their page. Please do not Buy any expensive phones from Amazon or Samsung. This is not over. Anyone that wants to join in a class action law suite please reach out. This is unacceptable.

Note는 성인 남자 큰 손바닥만 한 크기라 소지성은 다소 불편했지만, 화면은 넉넉했고 ‘탱크 폰’이라 불릴 만큼 내구성 하나만큼은 믿고 쓸 수 있었다. 그러던 내가 미국 생활을 하며 저가 통신사로 바꾸는 과정에서 폰 호환 문제를 겪었고, 결국 어쩔 수 없이 폴더블 폰으로 넘어오게 됐다. 그리고 오늘, 이 선택을 뼈저리게 후회하고 있다. 어제까지만 해도 멀쩡하던 폰이었는데, 아침에 일어나 보니 화면 절반이 죽어 있었다. 수리점에 가서 문의하니 “30cm 정도 떨어진 경우로 보이며, 이런 사례가 많아서 무상 수리는 불가하다”는 답을 들었다. 무상 수리가 안 된다는 논리는 이해한다. 하지만 구조적으로 생각해보면 납득이 되지 않는다. 모서리 하나 구겨지지 않은 수준의 생활 충격도 버티지 못하는 폰을 과연 폰이라고 할 수 있나? 삼성은 도대체 무슨 생각으로 이런 제품을 만든 건지 모르겠다. 순간, 태어나서 처음으로 애플을 한번 써볼까 하는 생각까지 들었다. 이유는 간단하다. 미국에는 Note가 없고, 심지어 통신사 호환도 안 되는 경우가 많기 때문이다. 결론적으로, 브랜드를 떠나 폴더블 폰은 일상생활용이 아니다. 모든 충격을 감당할 수 있도록 아주 두꺼운 보호 케이스로 감싸서 쓰거나, 아니면 고액의 수리비를 아무렇지 않게 감당할 수 있을 만큼 돈이 남아도는 사람만을 위한 폰이다. (참고로 폰 구매가 $750, 수리비가 $380 + 세금… 헉 소리 난다.) 삼성은 이런 형태의 모델을 하루빨리 단종시키길 바란다. 정리: 접히는 폰은 절대 사지 마라. 삼성 폰을 살 거라면 그냥 120달러짜리 삼성 기본폰이 정답이다. (영어) As a Korean who has used Samsung phones my entire life, I never thought I’d end up criticizing one this harshly. I’ve been using only Samsung Note series phones for over a decade. Notes were about the size of an adult man’s large palm, so portability wasn’t great, but they had a generous screen and were durable enough to be called “tank phones.” Then, while living in the U.S., I switched to a budget carrier and ran into compatibility issues. In the end, I had no choice but to move to a foldable phone. And today, I deeply regret that decision. The phone was perfectly fine just yesterday. I woke up this morning to find that half the screen was dead. I went to a repair shop and was told, “It looks like a drop of about 30 cm, and this kind of case is very common, so it’s not eligible for warranty repair.” I understand the logic behind denying a free repair. But from a structural perspective, this makes no sense. A phone that can’t even withstand everyday impact, with no bent corners or visible damage—can this really be called a phone? I honestly have no idea what Samsung was thinking when they designed this. For the first time in my life, I even found myself considering trying an Apple phone. Why? Because in the U.S., the Note series doesn’t exist, and in many cases, it isn’t even compatible with local carriers. In conclusion, regardless of brand, foldable phones are not meant for everyday use. Either you wrap it in an extremely thick protective case to survive daily impacts, or it’s a phone only for people who have enough money to casually absorb expensive repair costs. (For reference: phone price $750, repair cost $380 + tax… shocking.) I sincerely hope Samsung discontinues this form factor as soon as possible. Summary: Never buy foldable phones. If you’re going to buy a Samsung phone, a $120 basic Samsung model is the correct choice.",1.0,https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Smartphone-Unlocked-Manufacturer-Warranty/dp/B0F7JZFKMQ/ref=sr_1_94?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.iBcSzgpkJScsrkfbMhxKA5CsbzbHxNE1s00VSqn7feu6vH1H1uYyS2S0c7osSQlwHMulp1s-poFk5c7ds4rqpivfgGlW_j5aHy7Nmou5vlG6n7DfPRLcSDp3f_p6m3FplWJAvpqA3qbbhtTkf8IgKJ1L_hZQ4I3l1EAvIaLAQ0MvyD_xQgUCS2_ZhX2X16ohJkp9CNQEgkkbwcN4JRD9QefbwdXkd439RVRL2CzglbrWD1uOkk-S1DEXBkE8Nbxu-gkw-RTsSZbZY8UbZ4MZGLWZOf4COecZBoGf5jVXUYw.rO0iqTh-Gar67tBCDR0IxVwBs79S8E397uKGkFyL9gs&dib_tag=se&qid=1769857440&refinements=p_123%3A46655&rnid=85457740011&s=wireless&sr=1-94&xpid=FEes0W8Q3djsz,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/619w3H2V-3L._AC_SY300_SX300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,Samsung,"Android 16, OneUI 8",8,Exynos 2400 S5E9945,3.2,256,6.7,1080 x 2400,120,Galaxy Z Flip7 FE,328.86,6%,4.5,en

The battery still lasts super long & charges quickly with my fast charger from Anker. It had a couple of scuffs on the back, but it's barely noticeable. Especially with a case, which I always keep it in. It does feel comfortable to hold without a case, but I prefer having a case for popsockets. The phone functions perfectly, I was surprised for a refurbished one. The speakers sound how they should (my cousin got the same model but brand new so I was able to test) even with a privacy screen protector on, the finger print reader works as well as the face ID. I definitely can see myself having this phone for years. I play genshin impact & honkai star rail on it and they both run superrr smooth. I also used to play infinity nikki on it and that ran pretty well too. But these games do drain the battery quite a bit (obviously). It really does feel like a pc in phone form. I have successfully connected my phone to monitors, but i havent done much with that feature. (Samsung dex or something like that) (I took these pics with my iPad so forgive the quality, the phone looks more deep purple irl. But the phone arrived with these scuffs.

After 2–3 months of use, I’ve had no issues at all. I’ve since placed it in a case, and it has been performing great. The screen is definitely scratch-resistant, which I appreciate. Battery life has also been solid. I don’t live on my phone since I mainly use it for work, but it still holds a charge well throughout the day. The only unexpected part was the color—it arrived more muted than I anticipated. Thankfully, the case I’m using adds more vibrance, so I actually feel excited to pick it up now. The stylus and notes experience is the best I’ve had on any device. My only wish is that the pen felt a bit sturdier. Aside from that, no complaints. The phone arrived fully unlocked and ready to use.

Was able to drop my SIM card in and go! But it came with Android version 14 which is older than the version on my S22+ (v16) so I was missing some features I was used to. I looked more into it and my CSC was XAA (US unlocked) but the firmware version S928USQS4AXL3 was for TKM Android 14 (T-Mobile) and was preventing automatic updates. I flashed my phone to S928USQU4CYIS which is Android 16. Technically it's for the SM-S928U1 model which is the unlocked model. What i got from them is SM-S928U and that is a carrier specific/locked model. No issues with it and I have all my missing features, but this is not technically Factory Unlocked. Also my CSC changed to AIO because of my SIM being from Cricket being in the phone when I started the phone after flashing it with the firmware.

The phone’s model number is SM-S928U, which means it was originally carrier-locked, not a true factory-unlocked model (those are SM-S928U1). Because of this—or possibly another issue—the phone is stuck on Android 14 with One UI 6 and shows “up to date,” so it can’t be updated to the latest Android 15 / One UI 8. Cosmetically, it’s also not “Excellent” as described. There are noticeable scratches on the back, and the screen has faint white lines or faded marks beneath the surface that can’t be wiped away.

For the price and the various reviews I read, this is THE bang for the buck. Compared to a S24, S25 or S26 there isn't much missing and some would argue it's one of the last of the breed especially with the BT S-Pen (the new ones don't have anymore or have lesser features). It STILL has ""updates"" life left and WILL get One UI 8.5 (any day now actually). This is noticeably faster and better in pretty much every way. I didn't know what real battery life was until now. I can go a full day without a charge; my other phone I was lucky to get 4 hours of my normal use and even then I was on high alert to where the nearest AC plug is. To go from 80% to 50% was scary but that 50% to 20% when the S10 would power down to safe mode was a constant source of anxiety. With this it's like time is on a different measure. I could watch the % tick down on the old one, on here it barely moves. A true game changer. The ONLY ""gripe"" I have is this beast is a big-boy. It's probably double the weight and dimensions in every way. I can absolutely feel it in my front pocket and if I wear my PJs it will pull the pocket down even. Due to that weight it will also pull the suction cup mount off the windshield of the car more often than not so I had to switch to a cup-holder style that's more secure. It is curious why Samsung didn't let it wireless charge their own Galaxy Watch Ultra (when I try the watch says it's ""not compatible"" when I thought it is just Qi charging?) That's a real shame; not huge as the watch lasts a couple days as it is, but would have been a nice-to-have given it's all their same flagship stuff from the same time-frame even... I thought I'd miss not having an SD slot (and kind of do in a way) but I went from 256GB to 512GB internal now. Similarly I used to have the ol' Bixby button on the S10 commandeered to launch Home Assistant. I thought I'd miss that, but literally last night I discovered that the ""RegiStar"" plugin to Samsung's ""Good Lock"" (yeah dumb name) has the ability to assign all kinds of things to all kinds of other things. So now my main power button long-press launches Home Assistant. BOOM! Overall ""no ragrets"" and almost wish I'd done it sooner.",5.0,https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Galaxy-Ultra-Factory-Unlocked/dp/B0C51Q5Z9K/ref=sr_1_36?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.WK2dYbm7jqrYKzvA_635ffkLZ3yoSlXjjiBx3F0R20HmsmtMFXl5utBxuLtzl5LveVauZfgCiFE7SxRMserK_1mgHMXXPPVUGcdDXZefKQAsIrY-Wm-zLAyyvl1RkJ3o8bA9BQVQYNzoSdchdumoieYo8XyNiGl0Ajq2xITovIuQw9ki618C47OutM78aRW8A65JU5yHaXfWM36FP9oaIgFm2Hfombm727J5m8MN8YN4gyH9BWu8gMnNPt6MyB36UuVFV-wolI2QNcAH0A7Sa2L8RBoPeK0PPOsbJQdJssY.tkVezDMD8UzL1KpR_5lMSbbNxFiCNpZmG59J9O5Yy0A&dib_tag=se&qid=1769857421&refinements=p_123%3A46655&rnid=85457740011&s=wireless&sr=1-36&xpid=FEes0W8Q3djsz,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ZZO2wp8EL._AC_SY300_SX300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,Samsung,Android,12,Snapdragon,3.36,512,6.8,1440 x 3200,120,Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra 5G,235.31,64%,4.0,en

But I was trying to be budget friendly and had purchased a galaxy a16. This is a vast upgrade. I mean the a16 sucks so bad that I purchased this phone after having the a16 for about 2 months.

QUICK SHARE: Send even your largest files⁸—whether it’s","I purchased this Galaxy S23 Ultra from Big Box LLC on June 17, 2025, based on the listing clearly stating the device was “Factory Unlocked.” That turned out to be false. 📅 Timeline of What Happened: June 17 – Order placed and shipped same day. June 18 – Inserted SIM and discovered the phone was locked to AT&T. June 19–20 – AT&T confirmed the device was under an unpaid installment plan and ineligible for unlocking. The seller provided an incorrect unlock code, which they later admitted was missing a digit. After multiple failed attempts, the device became MCK locked — a high-level lock that makes the phone completely unusable. I spent over a week trying to get a valid unlock or MCK code from the seller. They kept stalling. June 28 – Seller admitted they couldn’t obtain the MCK code and instructed me to return the phone. ⚠️ Why This Matters: A factory unlocked phone should never require an unlock code — and certainly not end up MCK locked. I made 8 trips between T-Mobile and AT&T trying to resolve this. I lost 15+ hours of professional time, and the phone was bricked because of the seller’s incorrect information. After all of this, the only resolution was to return the phone — which I did under protest, with the entire incident documented. I’m grateful that Amazon support has been helpful and professional, but buyers should be extremely cautious with this seller. A device tied to a financing plan should never be sold as “factory unlocked.” If your time and peace of mind are valuable, look elsewhere.",1.0,https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Galaxy-Ultra-Factory-Unlocked/dp/B0C51Q5Z9K/ref=sr_1_36?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.WK2dYbm7jqrYKzvA_635ffkLZ3yoSlXjjiBx3F0R20HmsmtMFXl5utBxuLtzl5LveVauZfgCiFE7SxRMserK_1mgHMXXPPVUGcdDXZefKQAsIrY-Wm-zLAyyvl1RkJ3o8bA9BQVQYNzoSdchdumoieYo8XyNiGl0Ajq2xITovIuQw9ki618C47OutM78aRW8A65JU5yHaXfWM36FP9oaIgFm2Hfombm727J5m8MN8YN4gyH9BWu8gMnNPt6MyB36UuVFV-wolI2QNcAH0A7Sa2L8RBoPeK0PPOsbJQdJssY.tkVezDMD8UzL1KpR_5lMSbbNxFiCNpZmG59J9O5Yy0A&dib_tag=se&qid=1769857421&refinements=p_123%3A46655&rnid=85457740011&s=wireless&sr=1-36&xpid=FEes0W8Q3djsz,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ZZO2wp8EL._AC_SY300_SX300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,Samsung,Android,12,Snapdragon,3.36,512,6.8,1440 x 3200,120,Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra 5G,235.31,14%,4.0,en

The guy says to me that it isn’t compatible with 5g network meaning the out parts from an older phone in it. Some of the apps came up with Canada as the location. There was cell bars with absolutely no sim cards in it or digitally in it. But it was transmitting. He said that’s how they can steal all your information once you switch to the new phone. Sounded pretty nefarious to me. He also informed me of amazons third party sellers for these refurbished phones and how they are so much cheaper bc of all the corners they cut refurbishing them. Stay away from anyone that isn’t an actual retailer of Samsung galaxy’s I’m currently checking out Best Buy and checking out Samsungs website for one. They are pricier for sure.

I’m extremely glad I went ahead with the purchase — this was one of the best Amazon Renewed experiences I’ve had. First, the phone itself is excellent quality. It looks brand new, not refurbished. No scratches, no signs of wear, strong battery life, and smooth performance right out of the box. Now, about the unlocking complaints — especially important to clarify: This phone was sent to Asia, and it was still very easily unlocked by simply following the clear directions included in the box. The paperwork inside explicitly states that you do not need to pay extra to unlock the phone and that if the device arrives locked, you should contact the company directly. I did exactly that. Their customer service was beyond helpful — quick response, simple instructions, and the phone was unlocked very fast with zero hassle. The process was straightforward and worked exactly as promised, even for international use. After going through this myself, it’s clear that many of the negative reviews come from people who: • Didn’t read the papers included in the box • Didn’t contact the seller • Or assumed the phone was permanently locked without following the provided steps If you follow the directions they give you, the process is quick, easy, and stress-free. This company clearly stands behind their product. The phone quality is outstanding, and their customer service is truly top-tier — especially impressive given that this was handled across regions. I highly recommend this seller. Excellent device, excellent support, and a smooth experience from start to finish. 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟",5.0,https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Unlocked-Processor-ProScaler/dp/B0F3DJJR6W/ref=sr_1_72?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.nHV-0jU4w3_sT9KvY_tVrEm1xAio1yPCrFVhT80olTTPmnzzWfo78Yh4calJxQf5eskN_QdZ1RTaXX2AyRyp4SLqTU-ieEBrBURVj3S4qDuO-_U2Brgha-v2zs1DLJZAHd9S9OI1oUaqHxQz2RTyw7lAoZ5VqEsxLjkrV1NoOYDgm5f-71CmfNSIA0RW2UWcLML9B_jyTJlYcvmZV7cXdzzAQv8pXVGDvz3MzH1zEag5ZANh1XWWUEBcIRf9I-Qvq7HpE9D1o7BTgUjBLNTF2_Bhunl5M-t6h5CPB-lrpgU.bgtaWsNhI1o15ZQf6u6uNqHyIiJi4MAX_JOWRUOXLPE&dib_tag=se&qid=1769857430&refinements=p_123%3A46655&rnid=85457740011&s=wireless&sr=1-72&xpid=FEes0W8Q3djsz,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61C17Al0dhL._AC_SY300_SX300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,Samsung,Android,12,Snapdragon,4.47,128,6.2,2340 x 1080,120,Galaxy S25,161.6,69%,4.0,en

After a software update from the manufacturer, the phone has become unusable. After taking to both my carrier and Samsung twice it turns out it's now locked to a carrier (Verizon). I spoke with Verizon who stated that the previous owner broke their contract so they won't be unlocking the phone. I contacted the seller who tried to tell me that it is indeed unlocked, but the software update just reverted it back to the old carrier. They sent me instructions that required downloading two different applications on to a PC, then hooking my phone to it and what not. For one thing, I don't own a PC, for another thing, when buying an unlocked phone you shouldn't have to go back in to it to ""unlock"" it yourself. And, this just seems like a work around. I told the owner that I was told by Samsung, my carrier, and Verizon that this phone is locked to Verizon and he ""assured"" me this wasn't the case.  I think Verizon would know.

I had to return this phone so unfortunately do not get to enjoy the quality camera or other nice features. Try going for Universal unlocked if you can. As far as the device goes it was of quality and sturdy. It has what looks like a great camera.  It does lack the external port for wired earbuds and no microSD. I still think refurbished is a great option. Just make sure to test the phone as soon as you receive to make sure it will function with your carrier. Make sure you have the current sim card that does 5g to ease the transfer etc.  Even checking to make sure not blacklisted and finding it is ok does not mean it won't have the carrier compatibility issue. Now I understand the difference between the type of unlocked and I am sticking with factory unlocked(universal),3.0,https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Galaxy-S23-Version-Phantom/dp/B0C5S83319/ref=sr_1_32?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.WK2dYbm7jqrYKzvA_635ffkLZ3yoSlXjjiBx3F0R20HmsmtMFXl5utBxuLtzl5LveVauZfgCiFE7SxRMserK_1mgHMXXPPVUGcdDXZefKQAsIrY-Wm-zLAyyvl1RkJ3o8bA9BQVQYNzoSdchdumoieYo8XyNiGl0Ajq2xITovIuQw9ki618C47OutM78aRW8A65JU5yHaXfWM36FP9oaIgFm2Hfombm727J5m8MN8YN4gyH9BWu8gMnNPt6MyB36UuVFV-wolI2QNcAH0A7Sa2L8RBoPeK0PPOsbJQdJssY.tkVezDMD8UzL1KpR_5lMSbbNxFiCNpZmG59J9O5Yy0A&dib_tag=se&qid=1769857421&refinements=p_123%3A46655&rnid=85457740011&s=wireless&sr=1-32&xpid=FEes0W8Q3djsz,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/6133nDu6wcL._AC_SY300_SX300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,Samsung,Android 13.0,8,Snapdragon,3.36,128,6.1,1080 x 2340,120,Galaxy S23,167.26,5%,4.2,en

However, after using this phone for a month I noticed that the screen had more issues than just that. For one I had to clean the screen continously because it was more prone to smudges. Not to mention the screen had a really gritty and dry texture. I thought this would be easily fixed by using a screen protector. However, every screen protector I tried to put on it they would never completely attach correctly to the screen. It would either have bubbles that I couldn't get out or they would have these large dark spots. This is after trying three different brands of screen protectors. The biggest concern I had about the screen was when one morning I woke up to my screen having a lot of condensation. I have a very cold room due to having POTS so I have had all of my phones in my room for years and not one of them had this kind of problem. I also noticed that this phone had a lot of scratches on the case and even a big dent on the side. The phone I use to have was a Samsung Galaxy S10E. It was such a better phone than this one and half the price. I noticed that my S10E had a far superior camera than this phone as well. The pictures were very blurry and had terrible lighting, not to mention the video had terrible stability. I ended up sending this phone back. It just didn't feel worth the price. One of the good points of this phone was the set up and SD card insert. I had no problems with putting in my mint mobile card. I would not recommend this seller because it was not packed well and came with no charger or cord.

Got the s23 here and have had the worst connectivity issues I've ever had with any phone I've ever owned. I have 2 other phones that I bought on Amazon the S10 still works perfectly, the s21 had the charging issues but it was perfect for almost 2 years before that and it's still useable I just have to position the cord just so. This phone was awful almost immediately. Today alone I had to restart this phone about a dozen times in 2 hours bc it would sporadically disconnect and none of my apps would work. Super frustrating. It took me half an hour to pair new ear buds and it only worked after I restarted. I've missed phone calls and video calls bc my phone was not connected and I didn't know. It never shows a disconnection, I only know bc my apps stop working. Got my refund started and going back to my S10 until I find a decent replacement.

I'd been eyeing a co-worker's phone for a few years, and when I belatedly realized my Note 9 (which I hardly ever used) was no longer supported, I went for this right away. I think my only disappointment is that the S-Pen doesn't work the same on a Z Fold as it does for the Note. I'm happy with the screen, the battery life, the storage, the reception (not the best where I live, but this phone makes the best of it), the way the apps run, and the feel of the phone--although I keep it in a case, because I drop everything. I've yet to take more than one photo in it, but that one was fine. I may be firmly in the Apple walled garden, with my iPhone, Apple Watch, Apple TV, iPad, and MacBook Air, but I hardly use my iPhone anymore; it's now kind of just there to make certain features work on its fruity Companions. Some of my relatives who saw my phone over the holidays liked it. They lost interest when I answered their questions about the price, but my point is they were intrigued by my phone!

There WAS a slight sound when opening the phone, but after much inspection I've determined nothing is caught in the hinge, the sound also has went away. The actual phone is pristine and I've had very little issues with it. Coming from a z fold 2 this phone feels great.

Expected delivery was about 5-7 days but came on the 2nd day. The condition was said to be good but it's more of an acceptable condition, because there were some dings on sides and a scratch on bottom. Nothing too crazy because case covers them, but I mean thought the condition would be a bit better. The fold experience is definitely an experience and would definitely recommend it. Gaming,videos, multitasking is just amazing. The camera on the front is actually very good and the camera facing you is amazing...but all that changes once you open the phone up.

So I pulled the gun on the ZFold 4 because my ZFold 4's inner screen died out. This a common issue with any of the Folds or Flips.  And to replace the cable and/or Screens cost about $500 - $800... and from there, you wont know if the place did a good job or not as well .. Anyway, so I received the ZFold-4 when it was shown to be delivered. When i looked in the box, it was missing the power cube.. I kinda got upset about it, but after going back and looking at the description, it never mentioned it would have one... my fault there. So, I looked over the ZFold-4 and I actually tried looking hard for any scratches, marks or anything and could not find anything. This ZFold-4 was basically NEW... I was very impressed.. So,after setting up the ZFold-4 i found that since this was an unlocked phone  it did not have the T-Mobile applications ( which would be obvious) .. not a big deal though.. So i have been using this for a few weeks now and it is still running good. I have noticed though that the battery life is not as good though. I have to charge it everyday.. my other ZFold-4 it was about a day and a half before I NEEDED to charge it.. so not sure yet if the battery may be a issue or not... I will be testing a bit more.. and if the battery still shows signs of degradation I may have to send it back, or try for another one....",3.0,https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-Fold-Version-Phantom/dp/B0BKTJH8NZ/ref=sr_1_103?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.qNIx57btdigk7s-mUMFUobuAO57swX8T0jH6ivWxbg3qxKp2kE--JlgCh6bAA0tjya2MPMWYeWO7sqee5OvY4kEHYw4VuKDKtAk24cat8a40RkhYipj_QQrhVDlBSkhzl_h0GC9HgeLDFJv7xXfzDX53SkXpTvH74mJqAhe1TKsdoyQj3goCDER38gXeh6w42mTu7D5UfC9leoBlhozLbA5OSBAo3gH5he-SeYf_pVNKZ9MlMum8p1HhOue7TGaIXQO6H3XVr0FiZB2HsjXmSaPIUYZZgg34IPmNinDH6SI.XK11Kcl-WiM3o53GKBpm19Sn8CK-QLGWH7R29_FoGuU&dib_tag=se&qid=1769857449&refinements=p_123%3A46655&rnid=85457740011&s=wireless&sr=1-103&xpid=FEes0W8Q3djsz,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61bnnuvIcoL._AC_SY300_SX300_QL70_ML2_.jpg,Samsung,Android,12,Snapdragon,2.75,512,7.6,1812 x 2176,120,Galaxy Z Fold 4,257.98,6%,3.8,en

I ordered a Samsung fold 4 on January 9th, through this vendor on Amazon. The Phone was refurbished and several hundred dollars cheaper than anyone else, it also had the Amazon 90 day warranty so I figured, what the hey! The phone arrived a few days later and looked fine, after opening it and turning it on, I was prompted to enter my Wi-Fi password and then to log into Google for set up..... easy enough, but about 3 seconds later the phone went blank with a warning from Samsung. ""this phone has been temp locked by Samsung because it has been either reported stolen, lost in transit or not turned in on a phone upgrade. It gave a number to call Samsung so i did. The lady there said she couldn't help me and i needed to contact the buyer. I called them and asked what's up and they told me the phone wasn't on any black list and shouldn't be locked. They offered me a refund and sent an email with instructions to ship it back. Well a few days later they received the phone and issued a partial refund. The phone was locked with my google account and until I was able to unlock it, they wouldn't issue a full refund. I called them and was able to unlock the phone for them while talking and they said the full refund had been issued. When the first refund was issued I received an email almost right away saying i had received it. This time i got nothing. I waited a few days and still nothing. I called the company I used to purchase the phone through ( Affirm) and they said they had only received 1 refund. After several calls to the vendor and 5 or 6 calls to Amazon, we figured out the second refund was issued as a account credit or ""gift cert"" but that's not how it was purchased. So on the phone we go again, 5 more calls to Amazon trying to convince them the refund that I got just so happened to coincide at the exact second i received the gift card was the issue....Well, you'd think that would be easy to understand but nope!!! after a few more calls and being asked on each one to speak to someone higher up, i was told the issue was with the way it was refunded and Amazon had fixed it, I should get the refund in 48 hours...... 2 weeks later.... nothing, I finally gave in and said screw it, I'll just use the gift card. So.... in the end, the vendor sold me a locked phone, somehow between them and Amazon ( nobody will accept the blame) the refund was screwed up and i have a gift card now. Looking back I wish I would have just payed the extra money for a new, unlocked phone and skipped the middle person. Lesson learned I guess. The phone looked to be ok and if your willing to take a chance on going through with the giant mess I did, give it a shot. If you have bad luck and don't have time or money to spend on waiting and making phone calls.... I would give them and Amazon a hard pass. I know things can happen and do, but to ship out a phone that Samsung easily told me was on a black list seems strange..... I don't know maybe it wasn't but it was a time wasting ordeal, I for one won't be doing it again.

My friend warned me ahead of time that he had to switch back to a non-foldable, but I thought it was a matter of his uses and preferences. The front screen is both shorter and slimmer than most flagships, but I actually found it pleasant and easier to reach all the corners. Unfortunately, something about the phone's shape makes it so fragile that after putting it in my pocket with no other objects around it, the built-in protector started to crack after 5 minutes of me casually walking around the house. Even after putting on a case, there are now several large cracks in the protector despite no drops or impacts, just normal pocket wear, placing on counters, etc. The most disappointing part is the way it interacts with apps. The ecosystem just isn't compatible with foldables yet, so unless you want to be a pioneer with potentially years of hit-or-miss experiences, it's probably not worth it just yet. The compatible pen is also so large that it begs the question why they didn't make a normal sized S Pen and integrate it into the phone's body. You can only use the pen on the inside screen, so it takes away all of the quick versatility I enjoyed with the Notes.

The problem is that too much can go wrong with the hinge on folding phones. I learned my lesson on this Fold4. Excellent condition means no scratches on the screen, which it clearly has. I was willing to overlook, because the process to resolve it is long & tedious. But literally one week in the hinge failed & would not open flat. Also, all 3 folding phones I bought did not come with the screen protector Samsung strongly recommends for the inner screen. In this case I lost $39 because I had to buy one & then return the phone a week later. Be careful with the folders, especially the Fold4 which has a redesigned hinge. If you must have one, do your homework, & if you can hold out, buy new. That being said, the excellent condition brings with it 90 day return/refund so in that aspect it was a safe bet, but they can dock your refund for certain reasons.

My current phone is a Galaxy S9, it's year 2025 and with pending tariffs, and an outdated camera that has ruined many vacation photos (not to mention dropping the phone in Santorini where it slided down tens of steps), I decided to upgrade. I don't believe in buying full price and I've had great experiences with renewed products. It was delivered to me by FedEx requiring signature. The FedEx delivery driver came to my door, knocked very gently and patiently waited until I could get decent to open the door. Then because I was putting on the screen protectors, I ended up inspecting the phone very carefully and because the Flip is a foldable phone, running the phone to explore the Cover Screen features. The condition is pristine, not a single scratch and the phone runs beautifully. I'm sure my amazement is partially from jumping from an S9 to a Z Flip 6 and not 100% contributable to the seller, however I'm very happy. One thing I want customers to be aware of the phone, and this is not about the seller, I didn't expect the thickness it is once it's folded. As a woman, when I put my S9 in my suit pant pocket, it hinders movement. Also, I'm a motorcycle rider and a slab phone in women's jeans front pockets (they are shallower than men's) is a pain in my butt and my thighs actually push the slab phone out of my front pocket. The big selling point for me for the Flip was the compactness, so the thickness really threw me off. Especially because I thought I'd be able to use Google Maps on the cover screen with my motorcycle mount and car mount but I realize that that is not an option because it's so thick. Nevertheless, the camera is a big jump from my S9 and I plan to keep it. I read on Reddit that even in 3 digit speeds, the phone stays open on a motorcycle so I'll find ways to use it on my motorcycle.",5.0,https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Unlocked-Smartphone-Camcorder-Interpreter/dp/B0F2BPKXHW/ref=sr_1_89?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.iBcSzgpkJScsrkfbMhxKA5CsbzbHxNE1s00VSqn7feu6vH1H1uYyS2S0c7osSQlwHMulp1s-poFk5c7ds4rqpivfgGlW_j5aHy7Nmou5vlG6n7DfPRLcSDp3f_p6m3FplWJAvpqA3qbbhtTkf8IgKJ1L_hZQ4I3l1EAvIaLAQ0MvyD_xQgUCS2_ZhX2X16ohJkp9CNQEgkkbwcN4JRD9QefbwdXkd439RVRL2CzglbrWD1uOkk-S1DEXBkE8Nbxu-gkw-RTsSZbZY8UbZ4MZGLWZOf4COecZBoGf5jVXUYw.rO0iqTh-Gar67tBCDR0IxVwBs79S8E397uKGkFyL9gs&dib_tag=se&qid=1769857440&refinements=p_123%3A46655&rnid=85457740011&s=wireless&sr=1-89&xpid=FEes0W8Q3djsz,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61FSLViOMfL._AC_SY300_SX300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,Samsung,Android,12,Snapdragon 8 Gen3,3.39,256,6.7,1080 x 2340,120,Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6,187.11,69%,4.1,en

So far, after about a week of use, I have found the Z Flip to be an awesome phone.",5.0,https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Unlocked-Smartphone-Camcorder-Interpreter/dp/B0F2BPKXHW/ref=sr_1_89?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.iBcSzgpkJScsrkfbMhxKA5CsbzbHxNE1s00VSqn7feu6vH1H1uYyS2S0c7osSQlwHMulp1s-poFk5c7ds4rqpivfgGlW_j5aHy7Nmou5vlG6n7DfPRLcSDp3f_p6m3FplWJAvpqA3qbbhtTkf8IgKJ1L_hZQ4I3l1EAvIaLAQ0MvyD_xQgUCS2_ZhX2X16ohJkp9CNQEgkkbwcN4JRD9QefbwdXkd439RVRL2CzglbrWD1uOkk-S1DEXBkE8Nbxu-gkw-RTsSZbZY8UbZ4MZGLWZOf4COecZBoGf5jVXUYw.rO0iqTh-Gar67tBCDR0IxVwBs79S8E397uKGkFyL9gs&dib_tag=se&qid=1769857440&refinements=p_123%3A46655&rnid=85457740011&s=wireless&sr=1-89&xpid=FEes0W8Q3djsz,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61FSLViOMfL._AC_SY300_SX300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,Samsung,Android,12,Snapdragon 8 Gen3,3.39,256,6.7,1080 x 2340,120,Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6,187.11,69%,4.1,en

My idea for buying this phone was to be able to have Energizer video camera feeds on the small cover screen to quickly and easily access my cameras. FYI Amazon sells Energizer video cameras for a very reasonable price. Sadly when I first bought the Flip6, I read in multiple 2024 reviews saying that the cover screen was very limited to running only a handful of very simple apps. Then I upgraded the Flip6's software to Android 16 and also installed all the associated Samsung update software. Still a no go for seeing Energizer camera feeds  on the phone's cover screen. Then I found Samsung's Good Lock app, installed it and in the ""MultiStar tool"", under ""Life Up"", press "" I❤️ Galaxy Foldable"", then ""Launcher Widget"", I quickly found that I could easily put ANY phone app on the cover screen, including the Energizer camera app. I can NOW get live Energizer camera video and audio feeds on the Flip6's cover screen! I can also easily and remotely physically move the Energizer Pan/Tilt camera's motorized view positioning system from the cover screen. Please see my pictures. Originally when first released  in 2024, the Flip6 got many poor reviews for the number and quality of apps able to be running on the cover screen. Another bonus, when I log in to Energizer camera feed on the top screen, then when I open the flip phone the Energizer camera feed is displayed full screen!! I was able in early Dec. 2025 to get a 512GB Flip6 in like new condition from Amazon for only $416!!! ?? Absolutely awesome!

I’ll keep an eye on the battery as time passes because the phone dropped from 53% to 45% during set up. I’m unsure if that’s normal or not… Either way, the phone works perfectly fine!

Both had deep scratches on the screen and chips on the back. I would avoid any flip phones from Amazon unless they are new.  I am deeply unsatisfied as I paid for a higher tier refurbished yet still had the same issues. It's unacceptable to lie on the condition.  This is my last time buying a used phone on Amazon. Product has constant crashings, slows down due to thermal throttling, and worst of all it had a giant scratch/dent in the bottom right corner! I wouldn't recommend buying an used phone unless it's in very good, like new, or perfect condition. I bought a refurbished –good condition phone and it came with a deep gash on the screen. Screen is nice, and big. Having two screens is a big plus. The battery life is acceptable, not a lot but not little. It's perfect weight for me (has some weight, I don't like super light phones). I would say it's not a good value for the money because replacing the screen costs more than the phone itself.

I had it narrowed down between the oneplus 12/12r, pixel 8/8a and the galaxy s24. It's a hard pick, but when it came down to price, availability and software update schedule for refurbished, the galaxy s24 came through especially because I needed the 256GB version. The phone is as good as everyone reviews it to be. The camera is great, though this time it can actually auto focus unlike my s20 being sporadic. I really like the direction samsung is taking their software experience. Very useful apps and features, I don't feel like I'm missing out on anything important. Device care is one of my favorite tools. Maintenance mode is such an important feature. Diagnostics comes in clutch, I use it all the time to make sure my phone is in top shape and it does tell you when the battery life gets low as it did for me. When I got the phone, it got to work and automatically updated it's software to the latest versions all the way up to One UI 7 and android 15. Samsung plans to allow 7 years of updates I believe, which I'm all in favor for. I almost exclusively buy phones used or refurbished and even though 7+ years of updates may sound like a lot to some people or even excessive, it is perfect for people like I and many others who rely on used or refurbished phones. Last time I bought a refurbished phone, the s20 and I could only used it for 2 years before it will stop getting updates. Thank you samsung for  being a top contender in this area. I appreciate the fact they finally are keeping flat screens at least on some of their phone models. Curved screens became one of the most annoying things I've ever come across with a phone because it doesn't offer any improvements on function or easy of use and exposes my phone to more damage from drops and open sides. I want my phone case to fully protect my phone. Apple doesn't even do curved screens, get rid of them all samsung. I was hesistant to buy refurbished/renewed from amazon as you always hear mixed reviews for this kind of stuff, anywhere really. I did an exhaustive amount of research and finally got familiar with the pros, cons and what to actually look out for when buying refurbished so you have the best chance as getting what you actually want. Once you know what to look for, it's pretty simple, you just have to know which specific seller to buy from, but most importantly which to avoid. There are some red flag sellers out there and here on amazon, I suggest you do your due diligence and figure out who they all are. Macalegin or whatever their name is, is a great one though, just look at the seller's reviews and that should tell you most of what you need to know. I've been using samsung off and on since 2012 and they have improved so much over the years. Starting with the s20, I finally felt like I was able to experience the way android is supposed to be, smooth, fast, etc. Now with the s24, I feel as though I don't need to continue looking for a better android experience. It's already here.",5.0,https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Galaxy-S24-Version-128GB/dp/B0D364RMMP/ref=sr_1_34?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.WK2dYbm7jqrYKzvA_635ffkLZ3yoSlXjjiBx3F0R20HmsmtMFXl5utBxuLtzl5LveVauZfgCiFE7SxRMserK_1mgHMXXPPVUGcdDXZefKQAsIrY-Wm-zLAyyvl1RkJ3o8bA9BQVQYNzoSdchdumoieYo8XyNiGl0Ajq2xITovIuQw9ki618C47OutM78aRW8A65JU5yHaXfWM36FP9oaIgFm2Hfombm727J5m8MN8YN4gyH9BWu8gMnNPt6MyB36UuVFV-wolI2QNcAH0A7Sa2L8RBoPeK0PPOsbJQdJssY.tkVezDMD8UzL1KpR_5lMSbbNxFiCNpZmG59J9O5Yy0A&dib_tag=se&qid=1769857421&refinements=p_123%3A46655&rnid=85457740011&s=wireless&sr=1-34&xpid=FEes0W8Q3djsz,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51bdK6FaR-L._AC_SY300_SX300_QL70_ML2_.jpg,Samsung,Android,8,Snapdragon,3.39,128,6.2,1080 x 2340,120,Galaxy S24 5G,164.43,66%,4.1,en

However if you have your brightness on too high then it won't last as long. The phone is beautiful and sleek. It doesn't feel bulky or large in my pocket. I am able to add a phone wallet to the back and it still feels a good size. I promptly put it in a case, as I drop my phone all the time, and the screen hasn't cracked at all. Seems durable.

Battery is in good shape and lasts about 2.5 days on a charge with light use.  OS reports that battery is in good health.  No issues connecting to my Ubiquiti WiFi 7 AP on 2.5/5/6 GHz; peak link speed is over 2.6 Gbps.  Decent 5G coverage in my area which uses hybrid LTE/5G-NR radios; no weird call dropping.  No Bluetooth issues so far.  Speakers and microphone are clear. Phone was SIM locked to T-Mobile, which T-Mobile unlocked upon request in person.  No problem reflashing firmware to the U1 edition with Odin, which removes a lot of the T-Mobile bloatware.  Works great with Mint Mobile. In comparison to my older Galaxy S10e: glad to see the rounded screen corners and Bixby button gone.  The screen auto-brightness and fingerprint reader work much better.  The S-View cover doesn't support touch, but it doesn't block the rear camera anymore, either.  The Gemini AI stuff is everywhere and is difficult to remove.  Samsung is more insistent on you creating and linking a Samsung account.  A number of home screen widgets have weird font issues.  Using a USB-C headphone dongle is annoying and I'm worried that the USB-C port will break over time.",4.0,https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Galaxy-S24-Version-128GB/dp/B0D364RMMP/ref=sr_1_34?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.WK2dYbm7jqrYKzvA_635ffkLZ3yoSlXjjiBx3F0R20HmsmtMFXl5utBxuLtzl5LveVauZfgCiFE7SxRMserK_1mgHMXXPPVUGcdDXZefKQAsIrY-Wm-zLAyyvl1RkJ3o8bA9BQVQYNzoSdchdumoieYo8XyNiGl0Ajq2xITovIuQw9ki618C47OutM78aRW8A65JU5yHaXfWM36FP9oaIgFm2Hfombm727J5m8MN8YN4gyH9BWu8gMnNPt6MyB36UuVFV-wolI2QNcAH0A7Sa2L8RBoPeK0PPOsbJQdJssY.tkVezDMD8UzL1KpR_5lMSbbNxFiCNpZmG59J9O5Yy0A&dib_tag=se&qid=1769857421&refinements=p_123%3A46655&rnid=85457740011&s=wireless&sr=1-34&xpid=FEes0W8Q3djsz,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51bdK6FaR-L._AC_SY300_SX300_QL70_ML2_.jpg,Samsung,Android,8,Snapdragon,3.39,128,6.2,1080 x 2340,120,Galaxy S24 5G,164.43,11%,4.1,en

While it may work on any network you will not receive updates for the phone if it was previously locked to another network because the software is locked to a network. My phone was telling me it was up to date even though it was on Android 14 rather than Android 16. I did a few hours of research on Reddit and learned the above information and how to fix it. It requires downloading Samsung firmware from Frija and a program called ODIN and reformatting the phones software. It's not hard but it is time consuming. If your not up for the challenge, skip this device. From my research it seems to only be the s24 models with this problem.

Although sold as “unlocked,” the phone was stuck on Android 14. Samsung already says this model should be running Android 16, yet the phone claimed it was “up to date” and would not update. After hours of research, I learned it is still controlled by the previous carrier, meaning it will never receive Android updates under normal use. Checking the serial number or IMEI does not warn you about this. Another review mentioned this exact issue and they were 100% right. Fixing this cost me hours of my own time, and shipping was also delayed. If you want a phone that actually updates, buy a true factory-unlocked (U1) model.",2.0,https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Galaxy-S24-Version-128GB/dp/B0D364RMMP/ref=sr_1_34?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.WK2dYbm7jqrYKzvA_635ffkLZ3yoSlXjjiBx3F0R20HmsmtMFXl5utBxuLtzl5LveVauZfgCiFE7SxRMserK_1mgHMXXPPVUGcdDXZefKQAsIrY-Wm-zLAyyvl1RkJ3o8bA9BQVQYNzoSdchdumoieYo8XyNiGl0Ajq2xITovIuQw9ki618C47OutM78aRW8A65JU5yHaXfWM36FP9oaIgFm2Hfombm727J5m8MN8YN4gyH9BWu8gMnNPt6MyB36UuVFV-wolI2QNcAH0A7Sa2L8RBoPeK0PPOsbJQdJssY.tkVezDMD8UzL1KpR_5lMSbbNxFiCNpZmG59J9O5Yy0A&dib_tag=se&qid=1769857421&refinements=p_123%3A46655&rnid=85457740011&s=wireless&sr=1-34&xpid=FEes0W8Q3djsz,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51bdK6FaR-L._AC_SY300_SX300_QL70_ML2_.jpg,Samsung,Android,8,Snapdragon,3.39,128,6.2,1080 x 2340,120,Galaxy S24 5G,164.43,3%,4.1,en

I keep getting a notification that some features aren’t available because I’m using a non-Verizon SIM card. I reached out to Amazon customer support, and they initially offered a refund without returning the phone, but later changed their stance and now want me to return it and wait a month for a replacement. This has been frustrating. Pros: Phone in good condition Great performance and camera Cons: Not fully unlocked, with issues using a non-Verizon SIM Frustrating customer service experience Would’ve been a great phone if not for the unlocking issue.",2.0,https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Galaxy-S24-Version-128GB/dp/B0D364RMMP/ref=sr_1_34?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.WK2dYbm7jqrYKzvA_635ffkLZ3yoSlXjjiBx3F0R20HmsmtMFXl5utBxuLtzl5LveVauZfgCiFE7SxRMserK_1mgHMXXPPVUGcdDXZefKQAsIrY-Wm-zLAyyvl1RkJ3o8bA9BQVQYNzoSdchdumoieYo8XyNiGl0Ajq2xITovIuQw9ki618C47OutM78aRW8A65JU5yHaXfWM36FP9oaIgFm2Hfombm727J5m8MN8YN4gyH9BWu8gMnNPt6MyB36UuVFV-wolI2QNcAH0A7Sa2L8RBoPeK0PPOsbJQdJssY.tkVezDMD8UzL1KpR_5lMSbbNxFiCNpZmG59J9O5Yy0A&dib_tag=se&qid=1769857421&refinements=p_123%3A46655&rnid=85457740011&s=wireless&sr=1-34&xpid=FEes0W8Q3djsz,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51bdK6FaR-L._AC_SY300_SX300_QL70_ML2_.jpg,Samsung,Android,8,Snapdragon,3.39,128,6.2,1080 x 2340,120,Galaxy S24 5G,164.43,3%,4.1,en

I waited to do this review until I had it for a bit to make sure everything worked right. Well....IT'S AMAZING!!! The phone was not damaged in any way.  It looked like a brand new phone, right out of the box!  Not only that, but it functions flawlessly.  I don't use all of the features (and it has a lot of them), mostly because I don't do social media stuff, or take many pictures.  However, taking pictures is absolutely amazing!  There are sooooo many options: like filters, colors, cropping, picture size, frame size, etc.  There's just a ton of them. There is also Biometric features, which I appreciate.  I had the S9+ and the fingerprint reader was on the back.  If you use the fingerprint feature on this phone, make sure you set a passcode or pin as well.  The fingerprint reader is on the screen.  It shows as a pop-up.  Of course you have to go through the fingerprint set-up first, and can choose more than one finger/thumb.  My concern is that if the screen gets damaged where the reader is, the screen probably wouldn't be able to be able to read your print.  It does NOT have an iris scanner. This IS a 5G phone, but it can connect to 4G and other networks as well. I believe there might have been a SIM card, but I honestly don't remember.  I took the SIM from my other phone and put it in this one, so I didn't need it anyway.  I use AT&T pre-paid, and it works fine.  Right out of the box.  I don't know if it's unlocked to a variety of different network or service providers.  My service provider is AT&T, and the phone I got from this seller is also AT&T.  My recommendation to anyone considering purchasing this phone, would be to contact the seller, first and ask about supported service providers.  If you have AT&T, it's a total win!  :) This phone charges super fast, and the battery life is fabulous.  For my usage, anyway.  You absolutely have to use a fast charging cable, or you'll ruin your phone.  I believe it came with a USB cable, but I can't remember if the block was included.  Either way, if you need to get a charging block, and/or cable, MAKE SURE they're fast charging!!!  I thought the cable it came with was too short for my needs, so I bought a new one on Amazon that is specifically for the S23+...and phones like it. Another recommendation I have is to get an Otterbox.  BEFORE you start using the phone.  If you drop it, then a lot of money was spent for nothing.  The camera lenses on the back protrude.  I personally have the Otterbox Defender series, as the case itself prevents the camera lenses from touching any surface when you lay the phone down.  It's the same if you lay it face down.  The cover prevents the face from touching the surface of anything.  I would seriously consider getting a high quality case with this phone, instead of a cheap knock-off.  (Not all cases are created equal.)  The phone is constructed of metal, not plastic, so it feels very well made.  It's not a light phone, but not super heavy, either.  At least to me. The phone doesn't come in an original box.  At least mine didn't.  It came with the phone and charging cable.  I can't remember if it came with the little key that opens the SIM slot.  If it doesn't, you'll need to get one.  It also doesn't come with a manual.  Also, unless you get the S23 Ultra, there is no stylus.  If that's what you're looking for, the S23+ doesn't have that capability at all.  You aren't able to get an S Pen with it, as the S Pen wouldn't function, even if you bought one and tried. I would also like to mention that it's super easy to transfer your data and contacts (and whatever else) to the S23+.  I don't have any idea about transferring from an Apple product, though.  Samsung is my go-to for phones. As for settings, there are too many to list.  There is a specific one for the battery that I would like to mention, however.  It makes it so your phone doesn't charge over 80% when fully charged, which is important.  The phone won't overcharge that way and end up ruining your battery. As for call settings, there are a lot of those as well.  For people that are hard of hearing, there are options for that.  If, on the other hand, you'd like to protect your hearing and how loud the phone can get while listening to music or talking on it, you can limit the volume.  It has features for the blind, but I don't know what that entails.  It also has the car feature, but I don't know anything about that.  I don't drive. I hope this review was helpful.  :)",5.0,https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Galaxy-S23-Plus-Smartphone/dp/B0C4Q796XC/ref=sr_1_27?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.WK2dYbm7jqrYKzvA_635ffkLZ3yoSlXjjiBx3F0R20HmsmtMFXl5utBxuLtzl5LveVauZfgCiFE7SxRMserK_1mgHMXXPPVUGcdDXZefKQAsIrY-Wm-zLAyyvl1RkJ3o8bA9BQVQYNzoSdchdumoieYo8XyNiGl0Ajq2xITovIuQw9ki618C47OutM78aRW8A65JU5yHaXfWM36FP9oaIgFm2Hfombm727J5m8MN8YN4gyH9BWu8gMnNPt6MyB36UuVFV-wolI2QNcAH0A7Sa2L8RBoPeK0PPOsbJQdJssY.tkVezDMD8UzL1KpR_5lMSbbNxFiCNpZmG59J9O5Yy0A&dib_tag=se&qid=1769857421&refinements=p_123%3A46655&rnid=85457740011&s=wireless&sr=1-27&xpid=FEes0W8Q3djsz,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51yz4TrDNdL._AC_SY300_SX300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,Samsung,Android,8,Snapdragon,3.36,256,6.6,1080 x 2340,120,Galaxy S23+ 5G,195.62,70%,4.2,en

After reading the other reviews, one tip for anyone buying a refurbished phone that's unlocked, an unlocked phone does NOT mean it's an UNLOCKED SIM CARD, in fact,  mine didn't have a SIM card at all, which is fine with me, I had a SIM card already.  But SIM cards are often locked to a specific carrier even if the phone is not. So make sure you have a nano SIM card ready to use, even if it comes with one pre-installed, it may not be for your carrier. I used AI to give me a checklist to make sure all was good.  I suggest you do the same.  I got the ""Excellent"" tier and my phone definitely aligns with that but was way cheaper. Only complaint is that Amazon shipped it like a snail.  This is NOT an issue with the seller,  this is Amazon corporate making decisions on what they feel is most efficient and cost-effective, but when you're ordering a phone, you likely need it fast. And while if I order something dumb like post it notes and cotton candy flavored peanuts, they treat it like a life or death situation like it's a heart transplant and the clock is ticking, for this phone they were like ""You can wait, there's no rush"". But the seller gave me a great deal on a great item, so I can recommend you buy this still,  just be prepared to wait up to a week to get to you",5.0,https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Galaxy-S23-Plus-Smartphone/dp/B0C4Q796XC/ref=sr_1_27?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.WK2dYbm7jqrYKzvA_635ffkLZ3yoSlXjjiBx3F0R20HmsmtMFXl5utBxuLtzl5LveVauZfgCiFE7SxRMserK_1mgHMXXPPVUGcdDXZefKQAsIrY-Wm-zLAyyvl1RkJ3o8bA9BQVQYNzoSdchdumoieYo8XyNiGl0Ajq2xITovIuQw9ki618C47OutM78aRW8A65JU5yHaXfWM36FP9oaIgFm2Hfombm727J5m8MN8YN4gyH9BWu8gMnNPt6MyB36UuVFV-wolI2QNcAH0A7Sa2L8RBoPeK0PPOsbJQdJssY.tkVezDMD8UzL1KpR_5lMSbbNxFiCNpZmG59J9O5Yy0A&dib_tag=se&qid=1769857421&refinements=p_123%3A46655&rnid=85457740011&s=wireless&sr=1-27&xpid=FEes0W8Q3djsz,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51yz4TrDNdL._AC_SY300_SX300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,Samsung,Android,8,Snapdragon,3.36,256,6.6,1080 x 2340,120,Galaxy S23+ 5G,195.62,70%,4.2,en

This is my first time buying a renewed phone, so I was a bit worried I might end up with a defective phone or one with cosmetic damage, which I can't really stand. 😅 I went for the phone locked to AT&T just in case I ran into any issues. The phone arrived faster than expected. It came in a simple box, and the phone was wrapped in bubble wrap. It came with a usb-c cord for charging and sim tool. I was blown away by the condition of this phone. Phone condition is practically FLAWLESS--only very small, barely noticeable scratches around the charging port. The screen is in stellar condition. Like getting a brand-new phone. The phone was already charged to 67% out of the box. Setup was seamless, and the carrier sim card was recognized without issue. I didn't have to contact AT&T. Wireless data transfer went very smoothly, and I was able to connect to my other Samsung devices (Buds Pro 2, Tablet S8, & s10e). So far, the phone is very responsive.

I also transfered all my data from the Midrange A54 5G to this refurbished Flagship S23+. Ive gotten the Lavender color with 256 GB internal and 8GB ram and i got to say this Samsung Galaxy S23+ is something else. Not only did the one I recieved look as if its kept in close to mint condition, it also works just fine and is unlocked to use any sim card of choice. There are really small, unnoticeable and minor blemish/scratches but they are hardly there to the point that just looking at the phone makes it seem close to mint if not mint condition! Battery life when I teseted it out in settings says it holds up to 4,000 to 4,700 mAh when not charged when charging and not charged. so for me, it seems like a downgrade when comparing to my 7,050 mAh gaming phone.

The lack of a dedicated hardware  fingerprint reader is a deal breaker. This was my first Samsung in a phone going back to 08. It will probably be much last.

My phone started malfunctioning within a month, but seller refused to honor the Amazon Renewed Warranty. Fantastic phone, When I had to reluctantly, suddenly & unexpectedly upgrade my zflip 3 to a zflip 5 Renewed was my only option. I'm cost conscious & purchase most of my electronics from Amazon Renewed & have have been a very satisfied customer for around a decade.  This was the 1st time I've encountered an untrustworthy seller. Basically they said ""You received a product & that's the only thing we guarantee. Your case is closed"" I'm quite impressed with how useful the outer screen is. We couldn't hold full conversations through text with the zflip 3 so this new upgrade was a fantastic surprise. I got the zflip 3 simply for aesthetics, but I've been thrilled with how useful this line is which is why I'd  decided to only purchase flips from now on.",5.0,https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Galaxy-Unlocked-Smartphone-Graphite/dp/B0CN556RQ4/ref=sr_1_81?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.iBcSzgpkJScsrkfbMhxKA5CsbzbHxNE1s00VSqn7feu6vH1H1uYyS2S0c7osSQlwHMulp1s-poFk5c7ds4rqpivfgGlW_j5aHy7Nmou5vlG6n7DfPRLcSDp3f_p6m3FplWJAvpqA3qbbhtTkf8IgKJ1L_hZQ4I3l1EAvIaLAQ0MvyD_xQgUCS2_ZhX2X16ohJkp9CNQEgkkbwcN4JRD9QefbwdXkd439RVRL2CzglbrWD1uOkk-S1DEXBkE8Nbxu-gkw-RTsSZbZY8UbZ4MZGLWZOf4COecZBoGf5jVXUYw.rO0iqTh-Gar67tBCDR0IxVwBs79S8E397uKGkFyL9gs&dib_tag=se&qid=1769857440&refinements=p_123%3A46655&rnid=85457740011&s=wireless&sr=1-81&xpid=FEes0W8Q3djsz,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Jzh8XTxQL._AC_SY300_SX300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,Samsung,Android,8,Snapdragon,3.36,256,6.7,2640x1080,120,Galaxy Z Flip5 5G,187.11,67%,4.1,en

My wife loves it. She loves it because it folds of course. The build quality again of course top teir its samsung after all. The gorilla glass victus 2 gives you the glass protection you need. The build of the phone top teir the aluminum body of the phone makes it light and strong. The hinge is very strong as well compared to the moto razr that is made out of steel. The z flip 5 has the latest chipset. It is flawless butter smooth scrolling speed. The screen becoms very bright. The camera is what you would expect from samsung would be awsome it had the 23 ultra camera but because of the size of the phone it would very goofy with those big camera circles like the 23 ultra or the iphone 14 or15. The features are not gimmicky my wife loves tpee mode it is super cool my wife uses it all the time. I just wish you could do everything on the front screen as you could with the phone open. The 1 major downside to this phone is the battery life it is not very good other than that it is an all around really fun and durable phone to use. I would recommend this phone becasue as i said before its fun to use it is a durable phone it packs all latest processing speed strength pretty good camera and build quality. If you are looking for a folding phone with all the latest and greatest. If you want a folding that you can use and not be so limited on its capabilities this is the phone. The zfold is i think not functioning the tablet screen is i believe to much. Most people would not open the phone too often its there if you want but in day to day use its not usable i think and also that phone is super heavy who wants that and the front screen is too narrow. The razr is made from plastic body and steel hindge makes it heavy as well. The google fold is small i think and to wide. The zflip 5 is everything you would want in a foldable. Usefulness screen size is perfect when its folded when open screen is not narrow and odd looking. Not a heavy phone. The gap when folded is completely from 1 end to the other so there will not be any unexpected unfold. For the price here its a steal and amazon provides a pretty good buy back program if you have unused samsung phones or want to upgrade its a great opportunity to get rid of phones to get nice money off of this phone more than it already is. Overall i would get this phone there are way more positive things than negative.,5.0,https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Galaxy-Unlocked-Smartphone-Graphite/dp/B0CN556RQ4/ref=sr_1_81?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.iBcSzgpkJScsrkfbMhxKA5CsbzbHxNE1s00VSqn7feu6vH1H1uYyS2S0c7osSQlwHMulp1s-poFk5c7ds4rqpivfgGlW_j5aHy7Nmou5vlG6n7DfPRLcSDp3f_p6m3FplWJAvpqA3qbbhtTkf8IgKJ1L_hZQ4I3l1EAvIaLAQ0MvyD_xQgUCS2_ZhX2X16ohJkp9CNQEgkkbwcN4JRD9QefbwdXkd439RVRL2CzglbrWD1uOkk-S1DEXBkE8Nbxu-gkw-RTsSZbZY8UbZ4MZGLWZOf4COecZBoGf5jVXUYw.rO0iqTh-Gar67tBCDR0IxVwBs79S8E397uKGkFyL9gs&dib_tag=se&qid=1769857440&refinements=p_123%3A46655&rnid=85457740011&s=wireless&sr=1-81&xpid=FEes0W8Q3djsz,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Jzh8XTxQL._AC_SY300_SX300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,Samsung,Android,8,Snapdragon,3.36,256,6.7,2640x1080,120,Galaxy Z Flip5 5G,187.11,67%,4.1,en

There was one tiny problem with the device when I got it. A piece of rubber was sticking out of the side by the hinge in a way it wasn't supposed to, and I couldn't put it back. It did not seem to hinder use of the phone so I never bothered to report it, but given the 'excellent' condition it was supposed to be in I expected better. But the phone was otherwise pristine and has been working a charm ever since I got it. Phone is on par with all other flagship Android devices of the era, but does suffer from subpar battery life and only ALMOST stellar camera lenses.

Battery life gets me through the entire day with 50% remaining, but if I don't reboot it after a while it drains nearly all the battery in a day. The flipping is awesome. Cover screen quality is good, if a little low resolution, but it's not too noticeable. Inner screen is great. Hinge has a bit of play but nothing major. The sides where the hinge is has a weird little ribbon thingy that gets a little annoying sometimes. Face recognition is a joke, might as well not have it at all. Fingerprint reader is perfect. Cameras are just okay. They chose an ultra wide lens instead of a telephoto for whatever reason. I never use ultra wide, but I use zoom a LOT. The 1x lens is fine but low light sucks. I am glad I got this below its 1000 price point because I would have hated to spend this much. Will probably be going back to a slab for my next phone.

I saw the price on this refurbished Z Flip 5 and couldn't pass up the deal. Refurbished in ""excellent"" condition for less than $600, what a deal! I thought ""excellent"" condition meant maybe there'd be some scratches on the phone or maybe like some minor cosmetic damage to the sides of the phone. I received a phone with a crack along the entire width of the inner screen just above the crease. So not exactly the ""excellent"" condition that I had expected. That is my only complaint, though.

The Face ID unlock and Touch ID work great and the phone is overall in good shape besides the crack in the screen.

I really enjoyed this phone until 5 months later my screen completely blacked out, I can only use the small screen now. I have been very careful with this phone and took great care of the phone so I don't understand why the phone screen just blacked out like that. Now I have to buy a whole new phone because it only had a 90 day returned window which is over. I will definitely not buy from them again. I just went a head and ordered an unlocked Galaxy Z 6 flip to replace this phone but this time I paid the $200 for the two year protection because apparently these phone are known to have this problem and buying the lastest model has better chances of not being constantly flipped open. It says these phones can be flipped open 200,000 times or last 10 years 🤣😂 mine lasted not even 5 months. So if you buy this phone even though its an extra $200, definitely buy the protection. If I would've bought the protection for $200 then I definitely wouldn't have been  spending almost $1000 as of yesterday for a new phone and protection. Do not buy this phone without the two year protection warranty. They also have a protection plan for $9.99 a month of you can afford the $200 for two years. Your carrier will not replace an unlocked phone that you add to your plan unless you buy it directly from them. So the two year protection is definitely worth it unless you like spending another $1000 after spending $600 on a phone in a 5 months period. That's $1600 I have spent on phones in 5 months. I really wish I knew I could buy the two year protection in the first place and that I would need it with this phone, it would've saved me $1000. That's why I'm telling whoever reads this, please buy the two year protection they offer on electronics.",3.0,https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Galaxy-Unlocked-Smartphone-Graphite/dp/B0CN556RQ4/ref=sr_1_81?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.iBcSzgpkJScsrkfbMhxKA5CsbzbHxNE1s00VSqn7feu6vH1H1uYyS2S0c7osSQlwHMulp1s-poFk5c7ds4rqpivfgGlW_j5aHy7Nmou5vlG6n7DfPRLcSDp3f_p6m3FplWJAvpqA3qbbhtTkf8IgKJ1L_hZQ4I3l1EAvIaLAQ0MvyD_xQgUCS2_ZhX2X16ohJkp9CNQEgkkbwcN4JRD9QefbwdXkd439RVRL2CzglbrWD1uOkk-S1DEXBkE8Nbxu-gkw-RTsSZbZY8UbZ4MZGLWZOf4COecZBoGf5jVXUYw.rO0iqTh-Gar67tBCDR0IxVwBs79S8E397uKGkFyL9gs&dib_tag=se&qid=1769857440&refinements=p_123%3A46655&rnid=85457740011&s=wireless&sr=1-81&xpid=FEes0W8Q3djsz,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Jzh8XTxQL._AC_SY300_SX300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,Samsung,Android,8,Snapdragon,3.36,256,6.7,2640x1080,120,Galaxy Z Flip5 5G,187.11,5%,4.1,en

The phone would turn on and the outside screen worked, however, the entire inside screen went black all of the sudden and wouldn’t work at all despite trying to reset it. There’s no evident reason for why it stopped working, I didn’t drop it or anything like that. I was advised by a phone repair store to return it since the repair was going to cost more than I originally spent on the phone as I would have to completely replace the screen. After returning it, the company refused to refund me stating that the phone was damaged which is the whole reason why I was returning it in the first place as it was in the condition that I had received it in.

14,"Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra 5G, US Version, 128GB, Black - Unlocked (Renewed)",285.25,5000,"The Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra, launched in 2022, is a premium smartphone blending the S-series power with the Note's integrated S Pen, featuring a 6.8"" 120Hz QHD+ display, powerful Snapdragon/Exynos chip, 108MP quad-camera system with 10x optical zoom, and 5000mAh battery, still offering great performance, camera, and design in 2025.","It's always a gamble buying a phone that's renewed/refurbished, because you hope you're going to get what the seller actually promises (as opposed to a disappointing/broken/non-working product). This isn't my first refurbished phone, but I'm always a little anxious spending the money on something I HOPE is going to be good (as opposed to brand-new/unused). I bought this phone in refurbished/excellent condition. After reading multiple reviews on multiple refurbished phone listings on Amazon, my biggest concern was (always is) getting one with a damaged screen, cameras, or having it not truly be unlocked. I've had this phone less than 24 hours, but here's my take SO far (I can't speak for other people, these are just my experiences): 1) Yes, it was (for me) truly, 100% unlocked. Not even an ex-carrier logo when I first turned it on! (My previous 'unlocked' refurbished phone has a T-Mobile logo when turned on) I was quite happy/impressed about this. 2) No scratches (that I could see) on the front/touchscreen. There are multiple, TINY scuffs on the sides (not part of the touchscreen)/top edge/bottom edge of the phone - which I fully expected w/ a refurbished phone, and I'm totally fine with it (and this is if I'm REALLY nitpicking - they're really not that bad, though. It's just not FLAWLESS, which - again - I'm fine with). 3) 99% flawless on the backside - the ONLY thing I can see is a TINY scuff on the edge of one of the cameras (not the actual camera/glass screen itself), and this is cosmetic - it doesn't affect the quality of the camera (that I've noticed). 4) S-Pen pops out like it should, seems to be fine. 5) Charges just fine so far - both wireless and wired. 6) Popped in my SIM card (US Mobile, uses T-Mobile network), and it worked instantly. No phone/SIM-related problems so far. Everything - and I mean everything (data, wallpapers, photos, Samsung Notes from my previous phone, sounds/ringtones, apps, folders, etc) - transferred from my old phone perfectly (Samsung Smart Switch app). 7) Fingerprint reader works fine for me so far - and that's with a plastic-y (TPU?) screen protector that I put on it. I haven't noticed any real issues thus far - if anything changes, I'll update my review. OVERALL: For me, yes it's definitely worth the money. If you're considering it and you're on the fence (and I understand why you might be), I say go for it. I'm very satisfied, hopefully nothing changes in time. Buying refurbished is a great way (in theory, lol) to save money while still getting a phone you really want (I think they're normally way overpriced anyway). Shipping was great (got mine the next day!), no issues with packaging (very safe/secure), and the phone - while not literally FLAWLESS - still looks great, works great, and I look forward to using it for a long time to come! A great buy overall!",5.0,https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-S22-5G-Unlocked/dp/B09VD33WHW/ref=sr_1_7?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.IZthQETfgZ_94BMyZ4wxCZDSyykL3KflyE0J2qS9upHAUT_kwVjHlm79K9ZxYvKjpgZfvsrYtiiGnsUjuzAB8utTTWaPqFi31VL8gRCeq9VdrMUtIt9FXmShfw7jCOOnDUNa6fVJdPeeRhtPhZojc-CCDGdmcSLITd4dNNnsZcsC2k-ZEk1IjSTwBBATiW2Mj3w2mWUxNlbf9wlUK9-XR_Z7l80cwYoEXS0F_65Lf-iBXi8AETMpkPoxqPKKYuPWz9jrtD2viwzNYc82EdkA9I6SgMPwrfYtvAJrEwJXXRs.hTQzOK4_ECLs3fIneUVQ6FUlrl5YKDlfRhbTRABnc9w&dib_tag=se&qid=1769857411&refinements=p_123%3A46655&rnid=85457740011&s=wireless&sr=1-7&xpid=FPUY1SF7P-F1N,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/613Fp7fknhL._AC_SY300_SX300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,Samsung,Android,8,Snapdragon,2.5,128,6.8,1440x3088,120,Galaxy S22 Ultra 5G,226.8,57%,3.7,en
14,"Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra 5G, US Version, 128GB, Black - Unlocked (Renewed)",285.25,5000,"The Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra, launched in 2022, is a premium smartphone blending the S-series power with the Note's integrated S Pen, featuring a 6.8"" 120Hz QHD+ display, powerful Snapdragon/Exynos chip, 108MP quad-camera system with 10x optical zoom, and 5000mAh battery, still offering great performance, camera, and design in 2025.","I was a little apprehensive spending more on a used phone than I spent on my new OnePlus 6T 4 years ago. I'd done the research and decided on the Galaxy S22 Ultra (mostly for the phone capabilities) but wasn't willing to spend $1200, so I took a chance on a refurb unit. I've had it for a couple days now and I can say it was one of my better purchases. The phone arrived a day early, well packaged, and included the phone(w/37% battery charge), an adaptive fast charger, a cheap usb c charging cable, and sim removal tool. After close inspection, the phone showed no signs of prior ownership. It was in pristine condition just like new. It started right up and I got through the setup process. Being an unlocked phone,I figured I could just throw in my Cricket sim card and be ready to go. Cricket recognized the phone straight away, reminded me to turn on wireless calling, and I was back in business. Now let's get it charged up. I plugged in my OP6T usb c cable and powerpack out of habit and started messing with settings when I ran across the battery settings. It showed 2 hour, 13 minutes until fully charged. Ok, lets try the included charger and cable. I setup the included charging rig and the charging time was reduced to 42 minutes. Sweet!... until it wasn't. With the phone fully charged, I went to unplug the charger only to find it stuck in the phones usb port. No amount of wiggling in any direction would free it. Time to turn to Google for a solution. Not much help there other than someone suggesting sending the phone in for charging port replacement after suggesting the fast charger combined with a cheap cable may have allowed an arc to form in the port effectively ""welding"" the cable to the port. Panic set in as I resumed the wiggling process. I finally decided to pull harder and dislodge it, whatever the outcome. It came out finally. I plugged in my ""good"" cable and it showed ""charged"" so I knew it was working. I quickly disposed of the cheap usb cable so it could cause to more harm. Crisis averted. I can tell that the signal reception is much better than I had with my old phone. My old phone had good early morning reception where I work but it was shut down at 9:30 A.M. for the rest of the day. I was happy to see that was no longer the case with this phone. I had useable signal even inside the building. That in itself is huge to me. This a is a large phone. I work construction and wear carpenter jeans (with the pocket on the right leg) and all my previous phones slid right in that pocket with a slim case. This phone will barely fit naked. With the case I bought for it, it won't even begin to fit. Luckily the Unicorn Beetle Pro case has the belt clip so I can still carry it while at work... although I'm not a fan of the belt clip method. The case is very protective but makes the phone even huge(er). I have a slim case on order. The phone itself is fast, responsive and beautiful with more bells and whistles than any phone I've owned to date. It's going to take some time to start learning the tips and tricks that make this phone stand out from the crowd, otherwise it's a waste of this phones ""talent"". I'm hoping my luck and the longevity of the phone will keep this as my daily driver for years to come as Samsung has promised four generations of One UI and Android OS upgrades. (tl:dr) It's a big glorious phone sent safely at a good price. IMO... if you can swing the price, don't hesitate.",5.0,https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-S22-5G-Unlocked/dp/B09VD33WHW/ref=sr_1_7?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.IZthQETfgZ_94BMyZ4wxCZDSyykL3KflyE0J2qS9upHAUT_kwVjHlm79K9ZxYvKjpgZfvsrYtiiGnsUjuzAB8utTTWaPqFi31VL8gRCeq9VdrMUtIt9FXmShfw7jCOOnDUNa6fVJdPeeRhtPhZojc-CCDGdmcSLITd4dNNnsZcsC2k-ZEk1IjSTwBBATiW2Mj3w2mWUxNlbf9wlUK9-XR_Z7l80cwYoEXS0F_65Lf-iBXi8AETMpkPoxqPKKYuPWz9jrtD2viwzNYc82EdkA9I6SgMPwrfYtvAJrEwJXXRs.hTQzOK4_ECLs3fIneUVQ6FUlrl5YKDlfRhbTRABnc9w&dib_tag=se&qid=1769857411&refinements=p_123%3A46655&rnid=85457740011&s=wireless&sr=1-7&xpid=FPUY1SF7P-F1N,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/613Fp7fknhL._AC_SY300_SX300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,Samsung,Android,8,Snapdragon,2.5,128,6.8,1440x3088,120,Galaxy S22 Ultra 5G,226.8,57%,3.7,en

It arrived in good condition with only very minor signs of normal wear and tear—nothing too noticeable at all. I was a little nervous as I read some of the reviews... Originally, I wanted more than 128GB of storage since I take a lot of pictures, but I upgraded from the S22 Plus (also 128GB) which felt okay to me BUT honestly, the space is still enough for the average person. I use a lot of photo editing apps and take plenty of pictures, and so far I haven’t run into any storage issues. The phone works beautifully, especially with the S Pen—it’s perfect for quick drawings or notes on the go. The camera is definitely a highlight. I’m loving the night mode feature, which really brightens up photos taken in low light. Plus, the photo settings are super customizable, and you can even create your own filters from images. Overall, for just $300 on Amazon, I was surprised by how premium it feels and the fact that its unlocked. NOT GSM BUT UNLOCKED. Even though it's a 2022 model, coming from the S22 Plus, this upgrade makes it feel like I’m carrying a fancy camera around. Totally worth it.

I contacted them and they answered 2-3 days if I remember it correctly. Luckily they gave me the NETWORK PIN CODE. So just to be sure that YOU CONTACT AND ASK THEM FOR IT. But for the value for money, this is WORTH IT! Yes it had some scratches here and there but I don’t mind. It’s just in the sides and bottom of the phone anyway, and I use case so it doesn’t bother me that much. I bought this phone to have another ANDROID phone since I have more faith in android than iPhone (sorry fans), because for me it does more, and I can do more in android. So coming from iPhone mini 12, to S22U, it’s not that easy in size difference. But the phone itself is easy to use. it comes with cord and CHARGER BRICK! It's C to C charger as well! Thank you for that, I got the fast charger out of the box!! I can’t say about durability because from what I know, the phone that has been opened or “renewed” is not as durable as the new one especially when it comes to WATER RESISTANCE. But other than that, I guess this is STILL AN AWESOME SAMSUNG PHONE FOR 2024. Been using it since July. So I can really say it's a good buy. Edit: Sept 2025 now. My phone fell not from so high, usually from my sling bag or from my hand when my nephew's accidentally bump in to me, it got crack on its back. Buuuut still works great. How I deal with it? My case is usually clear since then, because I want to show color or photos behind my phone. So the solution? UPGRADE.... just the color though! Phone works fine so why change?! Hahahaha! Just get a skin! In a span of a year, I made my black phone to BLUE and MINT (GREEN).

No scratched screen or noticable flaws to be seen. It had enough charge to fire it up right out of the box but came with a charging cord also (charging box not included) I don't notice anything off at first, or maybe I did but I dismissed the glitchyness as my own doing. Thinking I must be pushing a button or in some other way activating a feature I was not intending to activate. Afterall this was a new device I was getting use to and a very big upgrade to the refurbished galaxy s9 w the very cracked screen running android 10 I was using previously. However it's been some time now and I'm sure that the glitches are not due to my usage or misusage. I have to restart the device about 10 times a day on average because to will randomly decide to not accept my touch commands and will only respond to the s-pen touch/control. This can get very frustrating since the ability to walk around with my little pen out tapping away at the phone screen is not always conducive  to my activities. I have not contacted customer service on this matter yet so I do not know if its a software issue or something. I likey will however be reaching out to them soon and will update my review with further insight if available. Other than the glitch the phone is very nice. The material is sturdy and sleek. The look screams of classic charm and beauty in line with the rest of the Samsung Galaxy family. It's got 5G capabilities and connects easily. Downloads quick  has the Samsung Knox enables for greats security. Large screen so streaming or playing games is great. The sellar shipped it out very quickly and it arrived on time. No issues with shipping. Last but not least (well in this case maybe it is least as well) I did a lot of research before deciding what type of phone to buy, I'm kinda thrift and do not buy things of any significant cost for myself without thoroughly looking into first. Then after I learn what I need to learn I spend a lot more time (and I do mean a lot!!!) searching through different sellers on dozens of sites and apps and stores (online and in person), checking with friends and friends of friends, searching social media......etc....lookibg for the absolute best deal I can find. And wen I look at a deal I factor in every bit of relative detail.

As far as the looks of the phone, it was in rough shape. Major wear and tear on the bottom — the paint looked rubbed off and faded, showing gray instead of black along the bottom bezel. There was some horrible sticker slapped on the back that I still can’t fully remove, no matter how much I scrub. It looked like someone used it hard, slapped a wipe on it, and called it “refurbished.” Battery life? Terrible. My old phone — which had less battery capacity — outlasts this one by hours. So clearly, no real battery replacement was done. It feels like they just cleaned it up with a little rubbing alcohol and shipped it out. As for performance, it gets hot pretty fast and sometimes lags even with basic tasks. And don’t even get me started on the fingerprint reader — works when it wants to, and that's not often.

The camera is absolutely amazing. It's lightening fast and never lags, freezes or any of that crap. I definitely recommend a screen protector!!!! because these screens with the curved edges can get REALLY pricey to replace... at one point I was tempted to just buy a whole new phone. Anyway, love the phone!!!! and then all of the sudden...... the screen went black on me for no reason. It wasn't cracked or anything... so i thought, maybe it just died?  i didnt recall the battery being so low though.. well , even the charging circle didnt pop up when i plugged it in, BUT it vibrated. it also vibrated when i pulled the s pen out. ok, so the phone is on.... the screen isn't working... but why? there is no reason for the screen to be black... while attempting to unlock my old s10+ through Samsung mobile i , for whatever reason, clicked play sound to find my s22.. it didnt ring. why?!???! it is enabled to be found.. the location and everything was on. whats going  on? welllllllp. after trouble shooting and symptom checking i discovered that my motherboard is failing. and its a really common problem with the s22 ultra! so my favorite phone.... has a motherboard issue. I just hope i can get all of my data off of it, and i hope that everything is backed up. it flashed on for a few minutes and i synced back ups but I'm not sure it actually finished before the screen blacked out again, or if it continued while blacked out.. anyway, this really really sucks.

The s9 is obviously old but it worked well so I figured I'd buy a newer version for personal use after my iPhone I had for 8 years finally died. What I was looking for in a phone: [  ] Ability to make calls/texts [  ] A great camera as I am constantly traveling and in nature and I don't like carrying an extra camera [  ] A large interface to view the photos I take. A few details in the beginning -The below issues have been present since getting my phone. I have just now became frustrated enough to write a review. -I have never dropped my phone more than 3ish ft (from hand to ground while sitting or standing), what I'd sat is normal wear/tear. These issues DID exist before, though I don't think dropping an electric ever helps it. I've never gotten my phone wet, too hot, plugged in to a non GFCI protected outlet, or hooked up to another computer where a data transfer cord could have transmitted a virus. -I run a paid VPN and use Firefox and duckduckgo -I live in a very metropolitan area where proximity to my cell providers towers are not an issue -I have a nice case I have had on the phone since purchasing and a screen protector Issues [  ] Answering phone calls: what I feel like happens most often is that when I attempt to answer an incoming call I press the green answer button. Then the  phone will stop ringing and bring up what I'll call the ""in-session call"" screen but it never truly connects. It will stay stuck on this screen with no one able to hear each other for up to a minute. I have talked to people in person (the one I was trying to communicate with) and they will tell me that they were sent to voice-mail. [  ] Placing phone calls: when trying to place phone calls, sometimes my phone will ring once then a recording will tell me the person I am trying to reach is unavailable or the number I am trying to reach is not in service. I knew that these two reasons were not valid before but I had an experience when needing to reach 911 where I was told the number was not in service. I have also verified this by sitting next to people I am trying to call and seeing that the call never goes through. [  ] Microphone crackles if playing outloud or on speaker and will continue making the crackling noise until phone is restarted [  ] Camera is just way less detailed than I thought it would be. I heard great things about the clarity before buying. And, when looking at the physical phone, seeing how many lenses there are on the outside, one would think this phone could produce some quality shots. But every photo I take seems pixelated. I have tried to narrow it down to a specific lens by tweaking zoom and frame but I have located it the fix. This may be a software issue as the lenses aren't scratched [  ] The autocorrect function is pretty lousy. One of the 3 options usually happens: 1, a word that is spelled correctly will be autocorrected to something that doesn't make contextual sense. 2, the correct correction will be made but it will be conjoined with the following word after typing. 3, a word is spelled wrong bybthe operator but autocorrect never pics it up. Funny enough, this example happened while typing the previous sentence. I left it just to provide example and put it into the attached media section on the review. [  ] Screenshots don't always show up immediately in your photos. The photo app may need to be closed out of first and reopened. [  ] Thumb print: huge issue here...it only works about half of the time. I have now just began putting my password in every time. This is a first world complaint, but if it is a function of the phone I bought, it should work more than half of the time. [  ] Trying to place the mouse in a specific place in a paragraph can be a nightmare. The sensitivity and touch technology for the screen seems cheap. I know this isn't the case but it can seem like it will place your mouse everywhere but where you want it. I have similar issues when trying to highlight a specific word/portion in text while making edits. Some good stuff [  ] The screen is very large and crystal clear. Samsung was able to utilize a really large portion of the front screen all the way to the literal edge The phone is great for watching videos [  ] The phone itself is very sleek and good-looking [  ] The battery life is surprisingly good. The lifespan does seem to fluctuate day to day as my usage usually consists of calling and text (no social media). If you reach 5% life though the phone has about 1-2 minutes left, unlike the iPhone which seems to vary. All in all, the first thing I would have done differently is to not buy refurbished. And secondly, in my very narrow experience, I think Apple makes a better product. The security on Apples devices is a HUGE selling point for me as well. I haven't had a security issue with this device, but I have tested the security of other android devices.",2.0,https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-S22-5G-Unlocked/dp/B09VD33WHW/ref=sr_1_7?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.IZthQETfgZ_94BMyZ4wxCZDSyykL3KflyE0J2qS9upHAUT_kwVjHlm79K9ZxYvKjpgZfvsrYtiiGnsUjuzAB8utTTWaPqFi31VL8gRCeq9VdrMUtIt9FXmShfw7jCOOnDUNa6fVJdPeeRhtPhZojc-CCDGdmcSLITd4dNNnsZcsC2k-ZEk1IjSTwBBATiW2Mj3w2mWUxNlbf9wlUK9-XR_Z7l80cwYoEXS0F_65Lf-iBXi8AETMpkPoxqPKKYuPWz9jrtD2viwzNYc82EdkA9I6SgMPwrfYtvAJrEwJXXRs.hTQzOK4_ECLs3fIneUVQ6FUlrl5YKDlfRhbTRABnc9w&dib_tag=se&qid=1769857411&refinements=p_123%3A46655&rnid=85457740011&s=wireless&sr=1-7&xpid=FPUY1SF7P-F1N,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/613Fp7fknhL._AC_SY300_SX300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,Samsung,Android,8,Snapdragon,2.5,128,6.8,1440x3088,120,Galaxy S22 Ultra 5G,226.8,5%,3.7,en

We bought two of these phones at the same time recently one green and one pink. The pink one works good, I do have a little less service and it sometimes cuts out in areas that every other phone I have had kept full service. I use the same carrier so its not a coverage issue. We spoke to the carrier and they had us replace our Sim cards with new updated ones to make sure that wasnt causing any issues(it wasnt). I like the phone and features so much that its not a huge issue for me, i will be keeping this phone for awhile..... HOWEVER.. the green one does not work for service unless it is on wifi for wifi calling and messages. Once off wifi it says emergency calls only. Its unusable.. I contacted the seller and let them know. It has been several days and I havent heard back from them on anything. These phones are christmas gifts, so I only needed a replacement that works as well as the pink one and I was needing it quickly but I am still having no luck reaching anyone. I contacted Amazon and they are wanting me to return the item and are sending the labels to do so. Phone features, colors, and design-5 stars Phone service, dropped calls- 3 stars Customer service from seller-0 Stars I'm only giving a 2 star rating bcuz the pink phone does work, it does drop calls but its usable and I really like the look, feel in my hand, color, and over all design of the phone. It is very sleek, pretty and was in perfect cosmetic condition, otherwise they would get even less of a rating. Very disappointed at the lack of customer service especially this close to christmas with needing to return and replace a gift. We had decided to return/exchange for the exact same one from the same seller, but with the lack of response we will try and find another seller entirely.

Initial setup went smoothly while connected to Wi-Fi, though I did notice the fingerprint reader did not work and the battery drained unusually fast. The real issue became apparent once I left home: the phone would not connect to my carrier’s network at all and showed “No network / Emergency calls only.” I spent over three hours troubleshooting with my carrier (Cricket / AT&T network), and they confirmed the error messages I was receiving only occur with carrier-locked devices. Despite being listed as unlocked, the phone could not be used on my carrier. After a factory reset done during troubleshooting, Wi-Fi calling also stopped working, leaving the phone completely unusable. I reached out to the seller multiple times but did not receive a resolution or confirmation that the device could be unlocked.

Because it’s jailbroken, it’s not truly compatible with my carrier and causes nonstop problems: It won’t switch to 4G when 5G is weak. Wi-Fi calling doesn’t work. Service is terrible even when my husband has perfect signal right beside me (same provider, same plan). The battery drains fast and the phone overheats randomly. App Store updates fail or apps won’t download correctly. Fingerprint scanner fails about 70% of the time. Bluetooth connections drop often or won’t pair right. I keep getting signed out of Hulu for no reason (maybe related, maybe not, but it started when I got this phone).

The phone showed up completely dead, taking 20 minutes of charging to even turn on, and had fingerprints all over the screen, so the presentation was basically non-existent.

I have always bought my phones refurbished and unlocked from Amazon and have never had any issues. The model of the phone itself is awesome and the camera is perfect. Which is a huge reason I went with this model. I was constantly getting compliments on the quality of my photos. I have zero complaints about the phone make/model. It also came to me looking brand new and in excellent condition. The phone seemed to work flawlessly for the first month and half that I had it. I had no issues at all and then one day it just stopped connecting to my network carrier. It worked completely fine until I would leave anywhere that I had wifi and then I would not be able to use my phone as a phone. I wasn't able to send or receive calls or do anything that required internet unless I was connected to wifi. Including google maps when I was trying to navigate somewhere. I tried troubleshooting a bunch of different ways including removing my SIM card and putting it back in, and I spent over an hour on the phone with AT&T who told me to clear my cache in my internet browser which seemed to work for about an hour then it would tell me ""No network coverage available"" anytime I tried to do anything. It wasn't my carriers issue because everyone else on my plan had zero coverage issues. I went back and read more of the negative reviews on here and realized I wasn't alone with this issue. Like I said, I'd never had any problems like this before with buying refurbished phones on Amazon. I don't know if this seller is bad, or the device itself just had some computing issues. When I requested an exchange for my phone I was told that they didn't have any more available and that I would have to receive a refund only available on the card that I used to purchase it. I ended up just going to AT&T and buying the new Galaxy S24 Ultra and I LOVE it.

THEY ARE FACTORY DEFECTIVE!! DO YOUR RESEARCH AND YOU'LL SEE THIS PHONE SHOULD BE RECALLED!! I really did enjoy this phone while it only lasted for about first six months. Then comes the devastating issues. The Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra 5g was and is being sold with now known manufacturing defects. The internal antenna disconnects unreasonably too easy. This phone can't even be dropped from 2-3 ft with a nice case. The antenna broke/came loose inside the phone 3 different times. The first time it just started showing ""Emergency Calls Only"" on the top left of the screen and this 🚫 where 5g should be on the top right side. This happened over 20 times a day, and after driving me insane for a couple days I took the case off and it had a small crack on the lower right side of the back glass. ( I've never had a phone crack inside a case before). So I got the back glass repaired. Then the next day the phone begins doing the same thing again, having no service more time than functioning correctly. So now's the next diagnosis saying the  antenna needs replacing and the  charging port must be replaced with an antenna repair. It worked for about 2 weeks and did the same thing again and there was no accidents or damage done to cause it. By now I'm way too frustrated and take it back and use the warranty of the repair shop. So I bought this phone for about 599.00 in July of 2024 and since then the screen cracked through a screen cover, the back glass broke through a strong case and I've had to get the antenna repaired 2 or 3 times now and now the phone is doing it again. It only lasted 2 weeks and now I can only count on it at home with WiFi. I've got over 1 thousand dollars in a phone that should've been 100% Recalled and Replaced with a different model. I hope it was only this year and this specific model. SADLY this has turned me to really considering going to an iPhone. I also had to change phone carriers(Boost Infinite to Mint mobile) bc at first I didn't think it was the phone causing the problems. And I've bought 10-12 accessories just for this phone.

Everything seemed great the first two months, and then I started having issues connecting to the network, with the phone only working on WiFi. Did all the Samsung ""fixes"" on their support page but nothing worked. Ended up going to a local phone repair shop that changed the antenna at a cost of $80 parts and labor.  That worked for another two months and I just started having issues with network connectivity AGAIN...knowing its eventually going to drop to zero very soon following the previous experience. Im not an electrical engineer, but I am in the maintenance field.  I think this phone has a serious design flaw.  My guess is the battery overheats too much during charging and softens or unsolders the antenna connection over time.  Again, this is my best guess why this phone, and many others I see purchasers complaining about the same issue here are having when it comes to connectivity with networks.  Samsung either really dropped the ball on this model design wise, or purposely made it cheap. Id recommend AVOIDING the Samsung S22 Ultra Edit: I opened the phone and pushed the ribbon cable back into the antenna and it worked again. So that's the issue.

I bought this phone September 12, 2024. Carrier coverage worked fantastic, cameras are amazing, still are amazing. Fast forward to February of 2025 thats when my cell coverage would randomly drop after doing an update. I contacted my carrier support, and spent hours troubleshooting, they asked me to check for updates, low and behold I had more updates cross fingers. After doing the updates I now have no cell service. Looked online and there are a lot of S22 Ultras and the newer Samsung phones with the same issue after updates from Samsung. Ive tried two different carriers, all networks Verizon, T-mobile, and ATT nothing except in satuated cell coverages like phoenix it will randomly gain and drop cell service. Ive read the 5g antennas and sim tray board can be faulty from the factory, had a shop change them with no success. Im in contact with Samsung to try and get the phone fixed, they had me go to a shop that said its more than likely the motherboard/mainboard for the phone, we cant fix that it'll have to be sent to Samsung to be fixed. Recontact Samsung and they can't even give me a price on how much its going to cost me to fix their updates screwing up my phone. Really disappointed with Samsung not standing behind their updates and products. I used to love Samsung, i had to move my sim card into my Note 10 plus and it works perfectly no cell issues at all. I will try and update after sending the phone to Samsung. Update 8/12/2025 Soo i sold the phone and bought a Pixel 9pro xl and it works perfectly with my carrier and no issues. I have a friend that has his s22U starting to have issues. My wifes S21U is now having connection issues and I've bought her a Pixel 7 pro.

Comparing side by side with working S-6 and S-7 phones this phone will not detect a Data signal in many urban settings where I could previously make and receive calls, offering the Ø symbol rather than (empty) reception bars. Calls will not come through unless I am on WiFi.  ( Wifi transmissions/receptions frequently completely drops off when moving from room to room in an average size house with 6 WiFi access points. Not so with the S-6 or S-7). ---->> October 4, 2023 Update: The phone refused to take or make calls unless I was almost underneath a  Cell Tower. I took it to Verizon, and they could not evaluate antenna performance. GeekSquad was also unable to evaluate poor connectivity. The phone simply failed to perform basic cell phone duties. (WiFi connectivity was weak also).  And So I took advantage of Verizon's Phone Insurance plan where they gave me a replacement at no cost.  --- In the End, this purchase was not worth it. -- ""Excellent condition"" seems to me should be a just tiny bit shy of new in the box. In my case the metal edge at the top and bottom had the finish worn off, and the phone appears to have suffered a minor drop as there was a noticeable but not deep, depression in the screen and metal rim at the top of the phone. (The screen may be made from a similar material as that for folding phones so that it does not shatter for some drop types) There does not appear to be any diminishment to the screen performance/color-saturation. -- The generic ""C"" charger cable does not easily fit into the phone.  The first time I plugged it in I could not get it to seat so I had to fiddle with it to stay in, wedging the phone to keep it from sliding out. While it showed charging had started it must have come loose shortly after as it did not charge over night. ""C"" connectors are supposed to fit up or down, but this one only snaps fully in one way.

The first thing I notice was any time the charging cable is plugged in, the phone becomes unstable.  Trying to type is a nightmare and swiping the keyboard in impossible.  The second was the screen.  An actual S22 Ultra has a nice crisp screen where as this one is kind of choppy at 120hz and gets overheated very quickly.  There is a huge border around the screen where the screen should wrap around and be squared off. See the image with the colors to see how it should look.  This is also how my neighbors looks on his S22 Ultra.  These is no note in the description that states the phone will come with a knockoff display.  The display also gets very hot, very quickly, and consumes battery quickly.  In comparison to my neighbors, it handles brightness well and uses much less battery.  Set to the same resolution, brightness and playing the same YouTube video, in 30 minutes, his dropped 4% and mine was hot and dropped 16%.

I ordered it, spent the hour or so getting everything in order and put the new case I already bought on it, and the lock button felt a little off. I thought it was because I wasn't used to having all of my buttons on the side of my phone instead of the back, so I ignored it for a while. Until the lock button downright stopped working. Couldn't lock my phone, which is a pain. I had to set my screen shut off to 15 seconds so it would lock itself. I reached out to them for help, or maybe even a credit so I could just go fix it myself and avoid the hassle of returning it and buying a whole new one, but they wanted it returned. Now for the best part. I ordered another one to replace the first one. The second one came in crappy packaging, the phone was dirty with grime on it like it belonged to a teenage boy, sticky stuff around the camera, even the pen was dirty when I took it out. *ew* I tried to brush past it as long as the damn thing worked and there were no scratches on the screen. I got most of the grime off, put it in my case, and started using it. Well guess what? It won't stay connected to any charger cords that I have. If it even moves an inch, it stops charging. So when I have it connected to my car through cord, every bump, it disconnects. Not very fun. Now I have to return this one. I ordered myself a phone off of backmarket for a much better deal, I'll be receiving it soon as well.

I got the one in excellent condition and it charges super fast. The battery is good . The graphics are good . It has awesome drawing/note apps and coloring options and the sound is good. The only one thing is it keeps downloading the same update over and over again but my old Samsung phone did the same thing but you can ignore it. Other than that the phone is perfect. It comes with a built in Bluetooth pen and I downloaded the diamond painting app and it’s like a mini sized version of my iPad and pen that I used for that app. I love it.,5.0,https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-Unlocked-Android-Smartphone/dp/B08HL64JS8/ref=sr_1_44?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.WK2dYbm7jqrYKzvA_635ffkLZ3yoSlXjjiBx3F0R20HmsmtMFXl5utBxuLtzl5LveVauZfgCiFE7SxRMserK_1mgHMXXPPVUGcdDXZefKQAsIrY-Wm-zLAyyvl1RkJ3o8bA9BQVQYNzoSdchdumoieYo8XyNiGl0Ajq2xITovIuQw9ki618C47OutM78aRW8A65JU5yHaXfWM36FP9oaIgFm2Hfombm727J5m8MN8YN4gyH9BWu8gMnNPt6MyB36UuVFV-wolI2QNcAH0A7Sa2L8RBoPeK0PPOsbJQdJssY.tkVezDMD8UzL1KpR_5lMSbbNxFiCNpZmG59J9O5Yy0A&dib_tag=se&qid=1769857421&refinements=p_123%3A46655&rnid=85457740011&s=wireless&sr=1-44&xpid=FEes0W8Q3djsz,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51K8fXcORkL._AC_SY300_SX300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,Samsung,Android,12,Snapdragon,2.42,128,6.9,1440x3088,120,Galaxy Note 20 Ultra 5G,204.12,59%,3.9,en

I don't use my phone super heavy and it's not uncommon to have 70% or more battery when I put it on the wireless charger at night, and it's *significantly* less picky about placement on the wireless charger than the old phone (note 8).  The car has wireless charging and it's also much better charging there; the old one would often not be in the right place and not get any electrons, where this never fails to juice up. I got the Note 20 because it's the last Note (currently) that has an SD card slot; I'm absolutely against some company gouging me hundreds of dollars extra for a 256GB phone when a 512GB SD card is under 50 bucks.  The drawback to that is this phone came with pretty much nothing at all but a charging cable, which isn't really adding any value.  It took me some time to find a way to get the SD card slot open, without their custom tool, because on this phone at least the hole is waaayyyy too small for a paper clip.  I finally unwound the spring from an ink pen, which was small enough and stiff enough to release it.  Seriously leave out the cable that probably everyone in the world has by now and put that tool in!  It's needed for the SIM even without an SD card. Speaking of SIM, moving my line to this phone was trivially simple.  The phone was apparently on T-Mobile previouisly and I'm on Verizon, and everything worked flawlessly right from the phone.  Put the SIM in, turned it on, and followed the instructions.  Done. I got a Note because, well, I've been a Note fanboy since the 4, when my old Droid with the hardware keyboard gave up the ghost, because of the S-Pen.  It's not something I use every day, but when I do use it, there is literally no alternative that works like the S-Pen.  If Samsung ever stops putting that on their phone I'll probably move on to something more affordable. This is my first ever refurb, and this one at least is exactly what one would hope; it physically indistinguishable from a brand new phone.  Even close observation in the light reveals no scratches or blemishes, it hasn't crashed or exhibited any wonky behaviour (knocks on head), and it's significantly snappier than the old one.  That's not just because it has more resources, I think it's because the UI has been tweaked.  For example when scrolling a long list this phone's ""inertia"", how long it scrolls untouched after a flick up or down, is much higher than the old phone, so it's considerably faster to browse by scrolling.  I'm sure other improvements have been made as well, and together they translate into a much more responsive feel. The OS itself is similar to the Note 8, really, but it has even more bloat and unremovable cruft in it.  For exampe there's ""AR"" functionality now, but even though I have nothing AR, and if I do it's highly unlikely I'll use this phone in conjunction with it.  There's an ""AR Zone"" that can't be disabled, can't be removed, can't be told not to nag me with notifications, can't be managed in the slightest.  Seriously Samsung, get off your high horse.  You don't know what I want my phone to do; fine if you want to have that enabled by default, why do I care?  But can't disable it or remove all the massively huge list of permissions?  Want to rub some salt in there for me?  It's also considerably more in-your-face nagging about things; like I haven't figured out how to get it to stop nagging me to save passwords for web sites, as if the last fifteen times I'd change my mind.  Stuff like that isn't helpful, it's obtuse and rude. Migration was a PitA, but that's normal, so I mention it anecdotally.  Samsung's ""Smart Switch"" does make it less than heinously atrocious, but ""Everything"" isn't (everything), and it still took me days to get all my appointments and other things loaded in.  Once I find my browser bookmarks and get them in I'll finally be done.  Least favorite part of getting a new phone is setting the @*&#% up.  I can back up and restore a computer with trivial ease but no phone maker yet is smart enough to do that with a phone.  Pathetic. I considered only four stars because of the missing SD card tool.  Not sure how many folks would be able to figure out how to open it with the hole being about 2/3 the diameter of a paper clip, which is by the way what Verizon recommends using if one can't find the tool.  I have no straight pins so I don't know if they work, but if I did I'd still want to file the point off to be sure I didn't damage anything. But overall a VERY happy camper.  If you like Android it's likely you'll be satisfied with this phone, and if you've never had an S-pen you'll probably be hooked.  lol",5.0,https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-Unlocked-Android-Smartphone/dp/B08HL64JS8/ref=sr_1_44?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.WK2dYbm7jqrYKzvA_635ffkLZ3yoSlXjjiBx3F0R20HmsmtMFXl5utBxuLtzl5LveVauZfgCiFE7SxRMserK_1mgHMXXPPVUGcdDXZefKQAsIrY-Wm-zLAyyvl1RkJ3o8bA9BQVQYNzoSdchdumoieYo8XyNiGl0Ajq2xITovIuQw9ki618C47OutM78aRW8A65JU5yHaXfWM36FP9oaIgFm2Hfombm727J5m8MN8YN4gyH9BWu8gMnNPt6MyB36UuVFV-wolI2QNcAH0A7Sa2L8RBoPeK0PPOsbJQdJssY.tkVezDMD8UzL1KpR_5lMSbbNxFiCNpZmG59J9O5Yy0A&dib_tag=se&qid=1769857421&refinements=p_123%3A46655&rnid=85457740011&s=wireless&sr=1-44&xpid=FEes0W8Q3djsz,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51K8fXcORkL._AC_SY300_SX300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,Samsung,Android,12,Snapdragon,2.42,128,6.9,1440x3088,120,Galaxy Note 20 Ultra 5G,204.12,59%,3.9,en

It is the most beautiful phone I’ve ever owned and I’ve had several dozen phones.  My daily phone is an iPhone 13 Pro Max because of work (Apple Ecosystem) so this phone was to take a break from Apple at times.  I also own a Samsung S20 Ultra so not new to Samsung / Android.  Out of the box I had connection issues with WiFi and cell phone switching.  When I left my house from WiFi into T-Mobile cell service I would get no service.  I then had to reboot  the phone, it would connect to cell service and then the phone would blowup with notifications.  It didn’t happen every time I left the house, was 50/50.  It also had issues with lag like it was out of memory.  Opening YouTube for example I’d get the spinning ball.  Checking for software update or cleaning the memory, the color dots wouldn’t even spin.  Then there is the battery (4500 mAh) which was extremely poor.  My best battery day was 3 hours 49 minutes onscreen time with 60hz refresh set.  For comparison my used older S20 Ultra battery (5000 mAh) best day was 9 hours 2 minutes (iPhone, 10 hours 16 minutes).  So I called around and found a Samsung certified store which quoted me $79 for an OEM battery replacement.  I would have totally changed the battery if the phone didn’t have the other issues.  I only used the phone for 4 days and after the second hard reset, I made the decision to return it.  I just sent it back today after receiving it 7 days ago.  Even with the issues, I miss it already.  I don’t miss the battery life and the hiccups but the phone itself was gorgeous (that 1440p screen).  It was no fault of the Amazon seller, someone would have to use the phone for days to detect these issues.",5.0,https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-Unlocked-Android-Smartphone/dp/B08HL64JS8/ref=sr_1_44?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.WK2dYbm7jqrYKzvA_635ffkLZ3yoSlXjjiBx3F0R20HmsmtMFXl5utBxuLtzl5LveVauZfgCiFE7SxRMserK_1mgHMXXPPVUGcdDXZefKQAsIrY-Wm-zLAyyvl1RkJ3o8bA9BQVQYNzoSdchdumoieYo8XyNiGl0Ajq2xITovIuQw9ki618C47OutM78aRW8A65JU5yHaXfWM36FP9oaIgFm2Hfombm727J5m8MN8YN4gyH9BWu8gMnNPt6MyB36UuVFV-wolI2QNcAH0A7Sa2L8RBoPeK0PPOsbJQdJssY.tkVezDMD8UzL1KpR_5lMSbbNxFiCNpZmG59J9O5Yy0A&dib_tag=se&qid=1769857421&refinements=p_123%3A46655&rnid=85457740011&s=wireless&sr=1-44&xpid=FEes0W8Q3djsz,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51K8fXcORkL._AC_SY300_SX300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,Samsung,Android,12,Snapdragon,2.42,128,6.9,1440x3088,120,Galaxy Note 20 Ultra 5G,204.12,59%,3.9,en

Several tiny micro scratches around the camera bezel, light scuff line near the bottom portion of the screen, but scuff invisible when using phone. Purchased this aging phone to replace my Note 10 Plus as the 20 Ultra was the last Note series that featured a physical sim card. My work provides an iPhone that I hate, but that iPhone has a physical sim, so I removed the sim from the iPhone and put it in my Note 20. Instant activation and Android bliss. Immediately noticed the performance upgrade from the previous Note, beautiful bright screen. Facial recognition and fingerprint reader massively upgraded from the Note 10. Actually works closer to Apple products, but still not as slick as Apple, but this ""new to me"" Note 20 Ultra is still an ""old phone"" with slightly outdated hardware.

When reading the reviews I noticed there are some issues that show up often. I bought from two, since the 1st had defects that shouldn't be in a phone listed as Excellent condition. I ordered a replacement, from a different seller, and have been happy. Putting the two experiences together, I came up with the 4-star review. These are the defects with the 1st phone I ordered. I got an incorrect display, which was too small with rounded corners and it didn't reach the sides or bottom of the screen. The back plate was loose on arrival, but that was mostly an inconvenience because I always use a case. Although, when I took off the case to return the phone, the back had separated from the body. The charging port had not been checked and cleaned out, meaning charging cords wouldn't connect correctly, so it would randomly stop charging. That was a rather simple issue to fix myself. I just shouldn't have had to with an Excellent condition phone. The main issue, and reason for the return, was that the phone didn't properly receive signal.

It still worked perfectly and I loved it but unfortunately I dropped it just the perfectly wrong way and destroyed the led screen. The phone was no longer usable. So I liked it so much I decided to buy the exact same phone. Over 300.00 for a refurbished model. I get it and first of all none of my pictures would sync. They all tried to but they all are just completely black. There are many other things that were different. Maybe due to software updates. When I first got it I thought it was defective because it went on for almost 2 days of constantly updating. I was upset but finally it stopped. The facial recognition rarely works and the fingerprint sensor doesn't work at all. I think it has to do with the Glas screen protector but it is specifically designed for a fingerprint sensor but it doesn't work at all. Since I broke the last one I don't want to have it unprotected. Overall I still enjoy this model but there seems to be numerous differences from my last one. It never gets hot. It takes decent pictures and has a lot of features to improve pictures. I don't think it should cost this much but it is a nice model phone. I would recommend it but just wish the biometric options worked better or even at all.,4.0,https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-Unlocked-Android-Smartphone/dp/B08HL64JS8/ref=sr_1_44?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.WK2dYbm7jqrYKzvA_635ffkLZ3yoSlXjjiBx3F0R20HmsmtMFXl5utBxuLtzl5LveVauZfgCiFE7SxRMserK_1mgHMXXPPVUGcdDXZefKQAsIrY-Wm-zLAyyvl1RkJ3o8bA9BQVQYNzoSdchdumoieYo8XyNiGl0Ajq2xITovIuQw9ki618C47OutM78aRW8A65JU5yHaXfWM36FP9oaIgFm2Hfombm727J5m8MN8YN4gyH9BWu8gMnNPt6MyB36UuVFV-wolI2QNcAH0A7Sa2L8RBoPeK0PPOsbJQdJssY.tkVezDMD8UzL1KpR_5lMSbbNxFiCNpZmG59J9O5Yy0A&dib_tag=se&qid=1769857421&refinements=p_123%3A46655&rnid=85457740011&s=wireless&sr=1-44&xpid=FEes0W8Q3djsz,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51K8fXcORkL._AC_SY300_SX300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,Samsung,Android,12,Snapdragon,2.42,128,6.9,1440x3088,120,Galaxy Note 20 Ultra 5G,204.12,11%,3.9,en

It arrived completely unlocked without a single blemish on it. I specifically chose this phone because it was the only relatively new model with ALL these features: 1. Memory card slot. I put a 512 GB card in it to make sure I don't run out of space. Almost every major phone company has ditched it. 2. Stylus. Because I do IT work using this phone from time to time, I need the precision of a stylus when selecting files or accounts. 3. UWB. I wanted Ultra Wide Band for some of the new connectivity. Pros: 1. Stylus is very accurate. 2. Good looking display. 3. Camera better than expected. 4. Speed is still great considering it's a 2020 release. 5. It's an Android. Sorry iPhone peeps, but Apple is way to controlling and hides too much. I was an iPhone guy up through 6, but I won't be going back in the foreseeable future. I currently have an iPhone 11 as a tester phone. Cons: 1. I wish the battery lasted longer; however, I do things that tend to burn through battery life. 2. Most of the time I do a screenshot, it also engages the volume level on the screen causing me to retake it too often. 3. The fingerprint scanner needs serious work. This is the most annoying thing about Samsung. My S20 FE was just as bad. I prefer the fingerprint sensor on my Pixel, which is on the back, so much more.

When I bought this my expectations were high and when received is when the problem started. Right out the box the phone had a busted up charger port. It worked at certain angles but still had issues. That would've been fine if it wasn't for the fact when I booted up it was said to be unlocked but came up with the at&t logo but even weirder is when I registered the phone with samsung it comes up with Verizon. I've contacted all 3 companies now trying to unlock the phone but no luck if it wasn't for the fact I use straight talk which works with all carriers I would be more upset by this. The phone condition was amazing not even a scratch which is good but the s pen came broken in 2, in which the seller partially reimbursed me for, still a disappointing out come.

If Asurion has contraced service centers in my area, why not have them do the repairs or service? It seems like common sense that if I can drop my phone off at a place locally that can fix it; they should be able to fix it under the Asurion Accident Protection Plan. Then I should be able to pay the service fee of $39 for a repair rather than $99 for replacement (which actually has hidden fees not mentioned until you process a claim!). The way it is set up now, from what I understand is that I have to have my phone sent into one of your service centers, wait to see if you can fix it, then if not I have to wait for a credit or gift card so I can replace my phone on my own. None of that even tells me how long I would  have to wait for the repair, if possible, or the credit. Why should I have to send my phone in for Asurion to see if they can fix it when there is a place right here that I can take it and have it fixed in 2 hours? The cost of the repair should be covered under the accident protection plan. The service center should be able to provide the repair service that should be covered underneath the accident protection plan. Asurion needs to update the coverage information for purchasers to read disclaimers that the phone must be sent in to one of your service centers instead of bringing it to a place locally. If I have to send my phone in, then Asurion should provide mailing supplies to send it into your service center instead of me having to take a somewhere. This whole thing has been very frustrating and annoying. It does not give me confidence in purchasing any more asurion accident protection plans as here I am with a cracked screen, that can be repaired, and I have no idea how long I would have to be without it in order to get it fixed or replaced. I work remotely and depend on my phone to do my work, therefore cannot be without it for any length of time. That is the reality of the world today. Remote workers and people who need their phones to do their jobs. Asurion needs to update their system to accommodate the way the world is heading or get out of the Accident Protection Plan business.

From experience, it's always a gamble. And gambling we love. Majority of renewed phones always look shiny with flawless screens. Know that this is common and a way to give you the ""wow"" factor. But also know these are not the original Gorilla glass screens that Samsung installed. These are aftermarket screens affixed by the reseller. I find that they are prone to cracks more quickly compared to Gorilla Glass. While my phone work great, the problem is the camera. Yes, it takes photos, but I cannot do close up photos nor does the auto focus work as it should. If you Google this, this is a known issue. Some people claim if you bang the phone hard enough, it fixes the issue while some just return it. Never ever use the charging adapter/cable that comes with renewed stuff. They are very often the cheapest, unbranded stuff thrown in to satisfy the buyer that they got a charger/cable. I find that some don't work and some charge erratic and slow.

Firstly, the device itself initially appeared great. Clean, shiny and new (used), IMO 8/10. It's been roughly about a month and I do like the phone, it's an upgrade from my Note 8 and functions IMO 7/10. In these last few days, however, it's been showing its semi- refurbished side. (I hope to upload pics) This device should have a water tight seal in its construction. This is not the case (no pun intended), with the back cover coming unglued there is now some separation that I can glide my finger nail through (thick nail). A rainy day will brick this phone. I am perplexed with how bright and vivid the screen is whilst also have some display issues. Maybe it's just me but when I'm streaming and there are darks or deep blacks it just gives you grainy video. Furthermore, as I'm swiping or trying to press on some functions either the touch screen or something doesn't respond to my touch on top sides. Having my finger holding or swiping motion with a picture or file toward the bottom of the screen causes a jitter and sometimes releases my item or causes an undesired selection. These are my main qualms and will look to resolving these issues.",2.0,https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-Unlocked-Android-Smartphone/dp/B08HL64JS8/ref=sr_1_44?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.WK2dYbm7jqrYKzvA_635ffkLZ3yoSlXjjiBx3F0R20HmsmtMFXl5utBxuLtzl5LveVauZfgCiFE7SxRMserK_1mgHMXXPPVUGcdDXZefKQAsIrY-Wm-zLAyyvl1RkJ3o8bA9BQVQYNzoSdchdumoieYo8XyNiGl0Ajq2xITovIuQw9ki618C47OutM78aRW8A65JU5yHaXfWM36FP9oaIgFm2Hfombm727J5m8MN8YN4gyH9BWu8gMnNPt6MyB36UuVFV-wolI2QNcAH0A7Sa2L8RBoPeK0PPOsbJQdJssY.tkVezDMD8UzL1KpR_5lMSbbNxFiCNpZmG59J9O5Yy0A&dib_tag=se&qid=1769857421&refinements=p_123%3A46655&rnid=85457740011&s=wireless&sr=1-44&xpid=FEes0W8Q3djsz,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51K8fXcORkL._AC_SY300_SX300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,Samsung,Android,12,Snapdragon,2.42,128,6.9,1440x3088,120,Galaxy Note 20 Ultra 5G,204.12,4%,3.9,en

I decided my whole family should have one as well. Well due unforeseen circumstances, my phone ended up needing to be replaced. So I ordered a new one no problem. Getting the phone was no problem but upon inspection, the excellent status of the phone was put into question. In the upper right-hand corner there was a barely noticeable screen deformity. It wasn't a deal breaker as the phone was still fully functional. But after preforming a usual task while at work, a break point occurred that cracked the screen significantly. I don't pretend to understand the science of gorilla glass but the cracks don't seem normal and it appears that the glas itself was deformed from an incorrect installation that is causing the cracked areas to be raised.

Can't tell you how the phone will work yet, as there are absolutely no directions or paperwork included.  As for ""excellent"" condition, yeah, not so much.  I'd judge it as fair to good condition.  There is a great deal of obvious pitting and scratching all around the edges, although not on the screen itself.  It is definitely visible from more than 12 inches away.  I'll be putting it in a case to protect it, so hopefully that won't matter if it's just cosmetic.  I just worry that this phone went through the wringer with it's previous owner. It definitely looks like it's been dropped a few times... I have to say, compared to my current phone, a Galaxy Note 9, also purchased as a refurb over 4 years ago, this one is a disappointment.  That one was pristine when I received it.  Still looks great due to it being in a case, but the battery is starting to go, doesn't hold a charge very long, and gets really hot, really fast.  Also the speaker is going and since I use it for work and do a lot on speakerphone, that's critical for me. I too chose this Galaxy Note 20 as it's the last in the line that has the SD slot. Now I just have to go searching for a user manual online so I can figure out how to transfer all my data and memory/sim/etc.  Once I actually, hopefully, get to use it, I'll come back and update my review. Update: I've had this phone for a couple of months now, and to say I'm underwhelmed is putting it mildly.  Cosmetically, it definitely was NOT in perfect condition.  Very obviously used hard by previous owner.  But I can deal with that.  What I can't deal with is the poor volume control, the fact that it cuts in and out, and locks up.  I find I have to restart it far to often to get it to work.  Not what you want in a phone. I use my phone a lot for work and not being able to rely on clear sound is a deal breaker.  And it's not like I'm walking around and the signal is fading in and out.  I live in an urban area, and talk to others in same area, and half the time I can't hear them or they can't hear me, or the sound cuts in an out.  So very annoying.  It's going back.  I'd better get a full refund or I'm going to be even more ticked.  This one was a rip-off in my opinion.  Completely opposite experience from my first refurb phone.",1.0,https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-Unlocked-Android-Smartphone/dp/B08HL64JS8/ref=sr_1_44?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.WK2dYbm7jqrYKzvA_635ffkLZ3yoSlXjjiBx3F0R20HmsmtMFXl5utBxuLtzl5LveVauZfgCiFE7SxRMserK_1mgHMXXPPVUGcdDXZefKQAsIrY-Wm-zLAyyvl1RkJ3o8bA9BQVQYNzoSdchdumoieYo8XyNiGl0Ajq2xITovIuQw9ki618C47OutM78aRW8A65JU5yHaXfWM36FP9oaIgFm2Hfombm727J5m8MN8YN4gyH9BWu8gMnNPt6MyB36UuVFV-wolI2QNcAH0A7Sa2L8RBoPeK0PPOsbJQdJssY.tkVezDMD8UzL1KpR_5lMSbbNxFiCNpZmG59J9O5Yy0A&dib_tag=se&qid=1769857421&refinements=p_123%3A46655&rnid=85457740011&s=wireless&sr=1-44&xpid=FEes0W8Q3djsz,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51K8fXcORkL._AC_SY300_SX300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,Samsung,Android,12,Snapdragon,2.42,128,6.9,1440x3088,120,Galaxy Note 20 Ultra 5G,204.12,18%,3.9,en

I am a lifelong Samsung product user, so you can imaging the devastation i felt when my Samsung s10e fell into a bath (and stayed in the bath for about a minute).  I purchased the Note20U (as it's the latest Samsung phone with the SD slot) and thought this was the push I needed to get a new phone. And it arrived in decent condition. It was scratchless, turned on with no issue and worked well, and I was quite happy - which would've prompted a 5 star review. However, on the 100th day of owning it, as I washed my hands, droplets of water landed on it. What shouldve been no big deal turned out to be the end of this phone. The phone turned off completely, and is no longer functional. The Note20U has an IP68 rating, the seller advertised it as Water Resistant, and it has no cracks or visible faults anywhere, and somehow the entire camera was full of water. How this happened, I'm not sure but I'm assuming that when the phone was fixed by the seller, they either forgot to or chose not to add the sealing that makes the phone IP68 rating-compatible. I did what anyone else would do - looked at the Amazon A-To-Z Guarantee, contacted the seller and I was told that because the warranty is for 90 days (it was 10 days after the warranty expiration), they couldn't help me with a replacement. The seller offered to reach out to their ""specialists"" to see if I could return it (but I'd have to pay shipping and a restocking fee?!) and when I followed up with whether these ""specialists"" responded, I was told that they would not be receiving it back. Amazon Customer service told me they couldn't do anything about this (all 7 agents throughout a weeks time) So now I have a broken note20u, no refund, no replacement and I'm currently typing this on the cracked, beat up s10e that survived with no water damage. My advice? Don't. And if you do - keep an eye on that warranty.",1.0,https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-Unlocked-Android-Smartphone/dp/B08HL64JS8/ref=sr_1_44?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.WK2dYbm7jqrYKzvA_635ffkLZ3yoSlXjjiBx3F0R20HmsmtMFXl5utBxuLtzl5LveVauZfgCiFE7SxRMserK_1mgHMXXPPVUGcdDXZefKQAsIrY-Wm-zLAyyvl1RkJ3o8bA9BQVQYNzoSdchdumoieYo8XyNiGl0Ajq2xITovIuQw9ki618C47OutM78aRW8A65JU5yHaXfWM36FP9oaIgFm2Hfombm727J5m8MN8YN4gyH9BWu8gMnNPt6MyB36UuVFV-wolI2QNcAH0A7Sa2L8RBoPeK0PPOsbJQdJssY.tkVezDMD8UzL1KpR_5lMSbbNxFiCNpZmG59J9O5Yy0A&dib_tag=se&qid=1769857421&refinements=p_123%3A46655&rnid=85457740011&s=wireless&sr=1-44&xpid=FEes0W8Q3djsz,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51K8fXcORkL._AC_SY300_SX300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,Samsung,Android,12,Snapdragon,2.42,128,6.9,1440x3088,120,Galaxy Note 20 Ultra 5G,204.12,18%,3.9,en

Now I have never had an issue with a brand new phone or a refurbished phone I've had many. My standard practice is to pull out the screen protector the OtterBox have them set up and ready and then open up the phone install the screen protector install it into the case and then upload all my information to the phone this ensures there's no dust hair fingerprints are Grime on the phone potentially as it is crisp out of the box however after I got into my OtterBox with the screen protector on which cost $50 I turned it on and after a minute I got an alert that my pen wasn't connected I went into the settings try to reconnect it after about a minute and a half of trying to connect it gave me the same error message I uploaded all my data updated the phone wipe the phone updated the phone without my data wipe the phone and my data updated and all the meanwhile I've changed various settings turn all the settings off turn them back on reset and every time I try to connect and then also every time I turn on the phone it tries to connect and it will not link Now there is one of two possibilities either I received a defective pen receiver or the flex cable that attaches the receiver to the phone was not plugged in Now this does not require an in-depth the way you literally boot on the phone and you get an alert with a very annoying Audible ping so you could not have missed this if you quality assured the phone The biggest issue is I return the phone I lose $50 I keep the phone I have to pay full price for a defective phone I talked to Amazon and we came up with a couple offers for the seller try and rectify things and they flat out refuse so I've been f***** over by these people because they didn't quality assure their own product that would have taken 2 minutes and you would have instantly known because you would have been alerted by the phone he didn't have to do anything and just had to be on for 2 minutes,1.0,https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-Unlocked-Android-Smartphone/dp/B08HL64JS8/ref=sr_1_44?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.WK2dYbm7jqrYKzvA_635ffkLZ3yoSlXjjiBx3F0R20HmsmtMFXl5utBxuLtzl5LveVauZfgCiFE7SxRMserK_1mgHMXXPPVUGcdDXZefKQAsIrY-Wm-zLAyyvl1RkJ3o8bA9BQVQYNzoSdchdumoieYo8XyNiGl0Ajq2xITovIuQw9ki618C47OutM78aRW8A65JU5yHaXfWM36FP9oaIgFm2Hfombm727J5m8MN8YN4gyH9BWu8gMnNPt6MyB36UuVFV-wolI2QNcAH0A7Sa2L8RBoPeK0PPOsbJQdJssY.tkVezDMD8UzL1KpR_5lMSbbNxFiCNpZmG59J9O5Yy0A&dib_tag=se&qid=1769857421&refinements=p_123%3A46655&rnid=85457740011&s=wireless&sr=1-44&xpid=FEes0W8Q3djsz,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51K8fXcORkL._AC_SY300_SX300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,Samsung,Android,12,Snapdragon,2.42,128,6.9,1440x3088,120,Galaxy Note 20 Ultra 5G,204.12,18%,3.9,en

I spoke to the seller and they sent me a return label. It was a week or two later that I finally had a chance to mail it off as I do not live anywhere near a dropoff site and of course, they never use USPS for the mailing. I mailed the item off and then received an email that it was received, and I should see my refund soon as they said they couldn't replace the item. No refund showed up, so I contacted them again. They then said that it was sent outside of the warranty period. We literally talked prior to it being out of warranty and I received the mailing label before it went out of warranty which was only a few days before it would've been out of warranty. I could understand if I had waited MONTHS, but it was only a week or two before I was able to send it off. I then asked them to return the product since they refuse to warranty it out. They stated that they need Amazon to send them my address before they can return it to me. This made zero sense as they sent me the product in the first place, so I said okay and spoke to Amazon and told them what the seller said, so they messaged the seller to return the product. I also used Amazon's assistant bot to send the address to the seller, but it shows up as a message coming from me. The seller again then said that this is not what they want, but the Amazon rep told me that they cannot send the seller our address as they do not have access to it. I conveyed this to the seller and told them to just send the product back to the original address it was shipped to in the first place which IS my address. I will see what the reply is and I'll probably being dealing with this issue longer. This was a whole lot of my time wasted on an almost 500.00 phone that worked for a short amount of time. I paid 300.00 to have my Note10 screen repaired, which is what the Note 20 was supposed to replace, and it's been working great, so I'll stick with that. I also bought my husband a Note 20 from the same seller and it is still working, but did the same thing mine did with the screen turning black and not working, but his did eventually come back on in a few hours.

I purchased my Note 20 Ultra 12/6/2024. Initially I was reasonably happy with the phone. It did have issues charging using a cable from the get go and I probably should have exchanged it then, but it charged wirelessly and everything else worked fine. I was just happy to have a functional phone. Today is 4/13/2025 just 5 months from the date of purchase. On 4/11/25 my phone decided that it no longer wanted to connect to cell services. It had entered into a half activated airplane mode that could not be overcome. I tried every fix and workaround listed on all the help boards I could find online. Nothing worked. I took the phone to a repair facility that tried to fix the antenna problem by swapping the daughter board, but it failed as the problem appears to be a deaper issue. I asked them to look into the charging issue, but the problem is deeper and more severe than simply swapping the port. The repair facility also noted that it was an obviously referbished model and that it had not been done well. There were several screws missing internally and the back glass was glued on with an excessive amount of the wrong type of glue. I'm fully aware this phone only comes with a 90 day warranty, but this product is claimed to come professionally inspected to look AND work like new. This does not meet with that claim.

I bought this phone as excellent quality refurbished and holy moly this phone was far from that. When i opened the box it had all it accessories but this thin slightly greasy film on the front and back of the phone, it was all over it and then the plastic film on the front glass of the phone had a bunch of lint and dust on it. I peeled it of and coukd see all the lint and dirt was on the sticky side that adheres to the phone screen. The screen was scratch free and crack free and so was the rest of the phone. But i noticed the color was off and not as vibrant as my s20 fe phone. The galaxy Note 20 Ultra is a top end high quality phone with high quality display. So to see it noticeabley faded and dull looking compared to my S20 it seemed liked something was wrong. Then i tried taking pictures with it and it did not focous well at all. I took it to a cell phone store and compared it to another used Note 20 ultra and they did not have one but the person at the front visually inspected the camera and took pictures with it and he said the camera needed to be replaced. So i just decided to return this phone and get a refund. The return mailing tracking number verified they have had the phone for over a week and still have not refunded me.. I called and was told anything over 100$ it takes about 3 weeks to a month for a refund. So just a heads up if you are interested in this phone and end up returning it. I was not impressed at all with theyre refurbishment quality. This is the second phone ive bought from amazon and have had the same type of experience.

Because if I would've known I was paying 500 for a phone that will only last me a year I would not have bought it or if it would've lasted at least one more year I would still leave a fair review, and like I said I don't blame the seller or amazon for this since I'm sure neither could've predicted this was gonna happen but i still lost 500 for a phone i should still have now.

When it arrived, it had protective film over the screen.  Even with the film over it, I could see a large 1"" long scratch on the screen.  Once the film was removed, the scratch was very prominent and could be felt on the screen.  There was also a corner that had been dropped at one point where it was dented and silver due to the anodizing being scraped off. I contacted Amazon right away and they agreed to send out a replacement since it was time critical that I get a phone for my employment.  Hats off to Amazon for their response, but the description by the seller was not accurate at all. UPDATE:  I received my second note 20 ultra from the same vendor, and this time the screen was okay minus a few minor scratches I can live with.  However,  this one has actual pieces of glass inside the bottom camera lens, from what I assume is from a glass repair that wasn't performed properly.  The telephoto function of this particular lense doesn't work properly, which is either a faulty camera or the glass is interfering with the movement of the lense.  When I contacted Amazon, I was not given an option for another replacement, only a return tag and promise of a refund once received.  I had to activate the phone since I could not receive any calls for work and now I'm in a position where I have to pay more money out of my pocket to buy another phone before I can send this one back and get my $400 back.

Received the phone, moved all my data over, input my passwords to all my apps, re-did fingerprint and face recognition, put my credit card info in Samsung wallet, connected different Bluetooth devices, etc.  You all know how tedious that is.  Received a phone call and the person on the other end could hardly hear me.  I thought nothing of it.  Received another call and the person could not hear me.  Decided to test the microphone.  It only picks up static.  Even in a room of silence the playback is pure static.  I have to use an external headset of some sort just to have a phone conversation.  Read online this is a problem with this model.  Even installing the latest software updates didn't fix it. At this point I had already traded in my old phone.  Contacted the seller and was told they wouldn't send a replacement until I mailed the faulty phone.  Was told they would overnight a replacement, but tracking shows it will not arrive the next day.  So, I'll be WITHOUT a phone for 2-3 days.  When I get the phone, I have to take time out of my day to go get it activated, have to take more time to put passwords back into all my apps, take more time to re-register my fingerprints and face ID, take more time to setup Samsung wallet, take more time to re-pair Bluetooth devices, etc. etc.  You get the idea.  It would be easier to accept this outcome if it were merely a used phone sold ""as is"", but this was a refurbished phone.  How did it ever pass inspection with a faulty microphone??

My Galaxy 8 was renewed, the first one didn't charge, sent it back and got the one I kept, but headphone jack never worked.

The only way I could tell this phone was not brand new, was two extremely minor surface scratches on the back, which is obviously expected. And the S Pen had a tiny bit of white paint on it, that wiped right off. Other then that, the phone was pristine, not even a fingerprint, until I picked it up. It started right up, charges perfect, it's unlocked, the S Pen works, battery life is basically stagnant if it's not being used, and it's absolutely beautiful.

Screen wise The screen is nice and bright, very colour accurate compared to my galaxy a10e LED panel. The note 10+ has a 91% screen to body ratio. Meaning most of the phone is screen. The screen itself is an AMOLED/oled display, really dark colours and blacks are at their best here. Screen curves do not impose too much accidental touches. Screen didn't arrive with a single mark.

I had a replacement in 2 days. I have no complaints with the replacement. It looks and performs like a brand new phone. The screen is super touchy but once I put a case on it that took care of that issue. I'm not one that needs the latest version or a super expensive phone so this one was perfect for what I paid for it. It was unlocked and compatible with Cricket Wirelss so all I had to do was swap out the SIM card from my old phone and I was up and running.

There is a super wide angle that my newest model doesn't have. The portrait mode also seems to be better for some reason.

Fast shipping A+ 2. Note10+ looks pristine A+ 3. Works on Verizon (unlocked). Just added Sim & works. A+ (came in AT&T box, was confused at 1st glance) 4. Battery in great condition. A+ Cons: the battery came completely drained & took a few minutes to respond after it was plugged in. I imagine this is why fast charging didn't work at first. To fix not fast changing, charge to 100% let the battery drain a bit 80%, with the phone unplugged from power, then flip the fast charging toggle a few times, finally leaving it on, in battery settings. Then press volume down & power at same time for 10 seconds to force shutdown. (you may have to change power button preferences from Bixby to Power button in settings. Mine was set to Bixby upon arival). Power on phone, plug in ""fast charge"" QC 3.0 capable cord & CHARGER to phone. Fast Charging fixed. Next step was to fix the wifi from intermittently turning off. In settings, go to ""connections"" then ""wifi"", click ""3 dots"" top right, select ""advanced"". Make sure 'Switch to mobile data"" is turned off. Go back to ""settings"" main menu, scroll down to & select ""General management"". Once inside select ""Reset"". Finally ""Reset Network Settings"". It'll explain that wifi, mobile data, & Bluetooth hardware will be reset to factory settings if u continue to ""RESET SETTINGS"", click it. Restart phone, reconnect ur wifi & fixed. (It was probably the 10 updates that screwed wifi hardware settings). But now all is perfect & running as should be & I don't fault the seller for the wifi issue.

Though the status of it was updated alongside actual package arrivals/departures so that was fine. Unboxing: Opening the unoriginal boxing the phone came in; It arrived in a plastic bag within a white cardboard box. The phone shipped with unoriginal wall adapter/brick & cable. And none of the OEM accessories like the AGK headphones nor an actual SIM Card Removal Tool. It came with a paperclip instead. Outside Impressions: • The phone was impressive lighter than my Note 9, which this phone was replacing. I noticed the weight difference immediately. • I inspected the rear glass and was blown away by the this color: Aura Glow. The finish and how well it captured light and reflected objects in its glass was and is still great. • The camera system was without damage or scratches. • However the metal frame of the phone at the bottom had deep grooves of scratches from a hard drop it seemed. It can be felt with hand and enough depth to catch on smooth surfaces. Damages were along the sides as well. • The build felt solid in hand, when I didn't focus on the damages from the past user. Study but light. Took some time to get used to. • The Screen was huge. 1440x3040 that can be turn down if you are concerned about batteyr life. Bigger screen to body ratio than my Note 9 as well while not bigger much larger in its actual dimensions for me. I have fairly large hands. What troubled me mostly was the damaged screen. It had a noticeable gouge in the screen towards the top right 1/4 of the display that simply could not be ignored. It was easily felt under thumb and finger and even visible with screen off/on. **I returned the phone asking for a refund as it was beyond regular wear and tear use. Synergy gave me NO problem whatsoever with this. And emailed me within a few hours to a day that they will process a full refund upon receiving the product back. I did pay shipping back for the device. I was disappointed with that however I am happy with Synergy's customer support even though my product was not as it should have been. It gives me confidence to purchase with them in the future as good customer service is hard to come by today. The only issues where the damages that I saw and tested the phone As for today, 4/14/22: I have ordered a new Note 10+ 512GB version this review is based on the good working device I received and couldn't be happier with the device itself outside of the features it loses from the Note 9. The Note 9 was truly the last no compromise Smartphone of the Era. So i wouldn't call the Note 10+ an upgrade > Note9(N9) as much as I would say a Left-Right change of features for the user.. • Fingerprint scanner: In screen fingerprint sensor.. While consistent in my use, it is slow to read even with developer mode enabled. • Face Scanner: To make up for the ""poor"" speed of the FP scanner I make use of the face scanner feature to unlock the phone. This isn't the same as the Iris Scanner from the Note 9 (N9) and it is not as secure as the Iris Scanner but to serves my needs the same and is faster than the finger print scanner and faster than the Note 9 Iris scanner (both have .5 animation speed in developer settings). • The features of the S Pen are nice but I haven't explored them all. I do consistently use it for various tasks and apps and signing documents and editing. • Camera is very good. MANY settings in the pro mode and many camera modes itself. I use GCam myself. Big improvement I believe. • Still testing battery life as the phone learns user usage to better optimize battery will update • Phone calls are clear and good. • Speakers are impressively loud as well. I'm glad because I watch videos/play music (Netflix/Crunchyroll/Spotify) often. Bottom firing speaker and earpiece speaker sound good to the ear. Snapdragon chip, fast and 12gb of ram. No lag and running andriod 12, running 4.1UI but I have a launcher that I find suits my needs better. You won't be made at this phone in 2022. I only upgrade, at most, every three years unless phone is stolen/loss/damaged outside warranty. Definitely happy with the huge screen, faster chip, S Pen, SD card slot (fitted with a 1TB  PNY) and factory unlocked.",4.0,https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-Note-256GB-Silver/dp/B08KRKFHGV/ref=sr_1_112?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.qNIx57btdigk7s-mUMFUobuAO57swX8T0jH6ivWxbg3qxKp2kE--JlgCh6bAA0tjya2MPMWYeWO7sqee5OvY4kEHYw4VuKDKtAk24cat8a40RkhYipj_QQrhVDlBSkhzl_h0GC9HgeLDFJv7xXfzDX53SkXpTvH74mJqAhe1TKsdoyQj3goCDER38gXeh6w42mTu7D5UfC9leoBlhozLbA5OSBAo3gH5he-SeYf_pVNKZ9MlMum8p1HhOue7TGaIXQO6H3XVr0FiZB2HsjXmSaPIUYZZgg34IPmNinDH6SI.XK11Kcl-WiM3o53GKBpm19Sn8CK-QLGWH7R29_FoGuU&dib_tag=se&qid=1769857449&refinements=p_123%3A46655&rnid=85457740011&s=wireless&sr=1-112&xpid=FEes0W8Q3djsz,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61BSoZRjsyL._AC_SY300_SX300_QL70_ML2_.jpg,Samsung,Android 9.0,12,Snapdragon,2.42,256,6.8,3040 x 1440,120,Galaxy Note 10 Plus,195.62,13%,4.2,en

Put the phone down to go to sleep, woke up the following morning and the phone wouldn’t turn on, wouldn’t charge or anything. Looked up Youtube videos and tried pressing the power button and volume up and down buttons for 15seconds but no dice. Reached out to Amazon and was able to return it and get a refund even though it was out of warranty but Amazon rep said i couldn’t get full refund but still got something back as it stopped working within the first year. Think i paid a bit over $300 including shipping and taxes and got refunded about $260. So, not bad but really intended to keep this phone.

Both phones appear and work like NEW.  Although they are ""unlocked"" for use with most carriers this phone (my 2nd purchase) is an AT&T branded phone and is loaded with AT&T's typical ""bloatware"" which cannot be removed without ""rooting the phone"" which I do not intend to do. I bought this phone for my wife and she really doesn't care about the bloatware since she really only uses a dozen or so apps. The phone has ample internal memory, 256 gb, along with 12 gb of ram this phone is powerhouse compared to her old phone (a Galaxy Note 4). She is happy and when ""Momma's happy I'm happy"". Commenting on both of the Note10+ phones I've purchased from this seller I can honestly say there was NO HINT ANYWHERE that either phone was ""renewed"" except for the generic white box they came in. They looked BRAND NEW. I watched comparison reviews of the Note 10+ vs. the Note 20 + prior to purchasing these phones and the thumbs up went to the Note 10+.  and the cost was less than 1/2  of a new Note 20+  The only other minor issue is the fingerprint readers aren't very reliable.

The only thing that gave it away was that I could tell it had a phone cover on it by looking at the dirt/marking around the camera lens. If the phone was cleaned properly I wouldn't have been able to tell it apart from a brand new phone. If you are wondering if the Note 10+ is good for you or not here is what I've found so far. Productivity wise it's amazing, it makes doing a lot of ""phone things"" easier. If your number priority is a great camera this one will disappoint you. I don't know what Samsung did but the camera in my opinion is terrible. I wouldn't use it to post on Instagram(Maybe a story) But other than that it's really great, charges really fast especially if you get the original 25w charger. The charger that was included was terrible and made a weird buzzing noise, so definitely purchase the Samsung 25w charger.

The phone is so lovely I don't want to use a case but for protection I use a thin clear case which is close to the sleek uncovered experience. I wish they'd stop with the curved screen on the Note line, it is frustrating to use the edges and tougher to protect. I appreciate it is running smoothly with Android 11 and I just upgraded to the Android 12 final beta. I do wish Samsung hadn't abandoned their VR Gear products because I enjoyed them and bought headsets and controllers which are now useless. I may still exchange or return the Note 10+ before the 90 day period because I've been annoyed by the speaker often causing the phone to vibrate in an unpleasant way even at medium volume. Also, since switching to it, a number of videos have refused to play correctly, instead showing jagged lines and I can't find anything online about the issue so I am suspecting a memory issue.

So bf was with no phone for a whole month and a half because his broke hence why I ordered this to be here in 3 days lol then they tell me to get a refund I must return the broken phone first. Would be fine if I now wasn't 270 dollars down until a month and a half so to get a new phone for the mean time would've been crazy and a waste of money. Nobody will steal a broken phone. Even version gives you a lender when they mess up. That's insane they expect you to have no phone nor ur money back in a timely manner lmao. Rude customer service as well. Not a discount or even a thank you for previously buying a phone from them and giving a nice review.,1.0,https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-Note-256GB-Silver/dp/B08KRKFHGV/ref=sr_1_112?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.qNIx57btdigk7s-mUMFUobuAO57swX8T0jH6ivWxbg3qxKp2kE--JlgCh6bAA0tjya2MPMWYeWO7sqee5OvY4kEHYw4VuKDKtAk24cat8a40RkhYipj_QQrhVDlBSkhzl_h0GC9HgeLDFJv7xXfzDX53SkXpTvH74mJqAhe1TKsdoyQj3goCDER38gXeh6w42mTu7D5UfC9leoBlhozLbA5OSBAo3gH5he-SeYf_pVNKZ9MlMum8p1HhOue7TGaIXQO6H3XVr0FiZB2HsjXmSaPIUYZZgg34IPmNinDH6SI.XK11Kcl-WiM3o53GKBpm19Sn8CK-QLGWH7R29_FoGuU&dib_tag=se&qid=1769857449&refinements=p_123%3A46655&rnid=85457740011&s=wireless&sr=1-112&xpid=FEes0W8Q3djsz,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61BSoZRjsyL._AC_SY300_SX300_QL70_ML2_.jpg,Samsung,Android 9.0,12,Snapdragon,2.42,256,6.8,3040 x 1440,120,Galaxy Note 10 Plus,195.62,11%,4.2,en

Since the seller was listed as Amazon Renewed Store,  I thought it would be a legitimately safe purchase, boy was I wrong. The phone itself came very nicely without any cosmetic damage with a new cord and generic charger. After installing SIM card from my phone carrier (Cricket), the phone show that it connected to the network. I was able to play around with it and use my data to download some apps. But then something odd happened, my mom complains to me later that day to say she was not able to call me and instead heard a recording that simply said ""this caller cannot be reached"". So I tried calling her, instead, it immediately goes straight to my carrier's customer service line. They ask what I need and I explain how I have new phone and I switched my SIM card to the Note 10+ and that I cannot make or receive calls, but I can use my data. She asks me to give the phone's IMEI number and looks it up. Before telling me what's up, she asks me in a curious tone how I obtained the phone in the first place, which I tell her I purchased it on Amazon.

So yeah, it met my needs perfectly - ONEUI 6.1 allows me to use this feature and i got a new device, thank you amazon!",5.0,https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Galaxy-S22-Version-Phantom/dp/B0B6D53G2V/ref=sr_1_49?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.nHV-0jU4w3_sT9KvY_tVrEm1xAio1yPCrFVhT80olTTPmnzzWfo78Yh4calJxQf5eskN_QdZ1RTaXX2AyRyp4SLqTU-ieEBrBURVj3S4qDuO-_U2Brgha-v2zs1DLJZAHd9S9OI1oUaqHxQz2RTyw7lAoZ5VqEsxLjkrV1NoOYDgm5f-71CmfNSIA0RW2UWcLML9B_jyTJlYcvmZV7cXdzzAQv8pXVGDvz3MzH1zEag5ZANh1XWWUEBcIRf9I-Qvq7HpE9D1o7BTgUjBLNTF2_Bhunl5M-t6h5CPB-lrpgU.bgtaWsNhI1o15ZQf6u6uNqHyIiJi4MAX_JOWRUOXLPE&dib_tag=se&qid=1769857430&refinements=p_123%3A46655&rnid=85457740011&s=wireless&sr=1-49&xpid=FEes0W8Q3djsz,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61HlcaCSo-L._AC_SY300_SX300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,Samsung,Android 12.0,8,Snapdragon,2.8,256,6.6,1080 x 2340,120,Samsung S22+,195.62,72%,4.4,en

17,"Samsung Galaxy S22+ Plus 5G, US Version, 256GB, Phantom Black - Unlocked (Renewed)",234.95,4500,Samsung S22+ 256GB Phantom Black Unlocked (Renewed),"I'll come back to this review every once in a while as I continue to use the phone. EDIT2: 7/9/2023 Okay the line is not going away after locking and waking the phone like it did before. You can see in the second picture, it's faint, but it's there (ignore the orange glow, that's from my old s7 that can't take pictures of other screens without struggling). The fact that it wouldn't go away makes me think it's getting worse. I had to restart it this time to make it disappear. Went ahead and started the refund process because it seems like it's getting worse. Unfortunate because this was labeled as an excellent condition phone too. I guess it's hit or miss what you get when you buy refurbished. I'm not a phone repairman, so I'm not going to be able to open it up and figure it out. I'm just gonna refund this and get a different phone to avoid the problem happening again. EDIT: Okay, it's been 4 days since the review. Woke this morning and unlocked my phone, typical. Was adjusting notification volume settings then all of a sudden BAM, bright PINK (not green this time) line right through the same spot as usually from top to bottom of the screen. Wanted to take a picture with my old phone but was afraid of leaving the error on the screen for too long (was busy using restroom) so I locked the phone and unlocked it again and the line went away. Man... I might return this thing because this is scaring me. So far the phone has been pretty great. One thing's for sure though, it's crazy the difference (s7 to s22+) 2 oz of weight (including cases) can feel while holding it. This thing feels like I'm holding a brick compared to my old phone lol. All of these things that I am giving it accolades for are, of course, from a biased perspective of somebody who has used the s7 since it's launch, so take it with a grain of salt if you are coming from something like an s20 or later. Great/Solid battery, Great performance, Great visuals. Little heavy though. Those are the main points. Since it is refurbished, the only actual visible damage you can see well is the small scratch at the bottom left corner of the screen (as seen in picture) that is on the glass for a length of about 2mm and then goes off to the side a bit. Not a problem though, it's quite out of the way. Saving around $350 just to have a scratch on the screen is quite the deal. I make my phones last, so this thing is going to be built like a tank by the time I'm done putting protective layers and cases on it. (This is the reason for the 4/5 and not 5/5) So far my only real scare with this phone (purchased as an excellent condition renewed s22+ with 256gb storage from Macalegin Electronics) is, since I've received it as of June 29th, it's now July 3rd, it's had this very thin vertical green line from the top of the screen to the bottom of the screen 3 times upon waking the phone. Seems to really only happen when I wake the phone. If I see it again I'll try to take a picture with my old phone and add it to the review. First time it happened I kinda had a mini freak-out, thinking that this is the end of having this phone and I gotta return it before it's too late and it gets worse. If it does get worse and more frequent, then I will get the refund because that's unacceptable as an excellent condition phone. Some people online say that it is because of a loose connection from the motherboard to the screen panel (I don't know the actual technical lingo), usually caused by the phone being dropped. Well, it's ""brand new"" to me, so it wasn't me who dropped it. Either way, the phone is great except for that scare. To be honest though, I do miss my more compact and sleek phone designs. I do kinda wish I had gotten the s22 instead, but I wanted to see what it's like having a bigger screen. Well, we'll see as the years go by.",4.0,https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Galaxy-S22-Version-Phantom/dp/B0B6D53G2V/ref=sr_1_49?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.nHV-0jU4w3_sT9KvY_tVrEm1xAio1yPCrFVhT80olTTPmnzzWfo78Yh4calJxQf5eskN_QdZ1RTaXX2AyRyp4SLqTU-ieEBrBURVj3S4qDuO-_U2Brgha-v2zs1DLJZAHd9S9OI1oUaqHxQz2RTyw7lAoZ5VqEsxLjkrV1NoOYDgm5f-71CmfNSIA0RW2UWcLML9B_jyTJlYcvmZV7cXdzzAQv8pXVGDvz3MzH1zEag5ZANh1XWWUEBcIRf9I-Qvq7HpE9D1o7BTgUjBLNTF2_Bhunl5M-t6h5CPB-lrpgU.bgtaWsNhI1o15ZQf6u6uNqHyIiJi4MAX_JOWRUOXLPE&dib_tag=se&qid=1769857430&refinements=p_123%3A46655&rnid=85457740011&s=wireless&sr=1-49&xpid=FEes0W8Q3djsz,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61HlcaCSo-L._AC_SY300_SX300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,Samsung,Android 12.0,8,Snapdragon,2.8,256,6.6,1080 x 2340,120,Samsung S22+,195.62,12%,4.4,en

I purchased this phone because I could not find a phone that isn't massive but that still had the features and performance I require for daily use, so I decided to try this renewed Flip 4. The 90 day return policy and the great price convinced me to try it out. Not sure if I can name the seller in the review but I basically selected the phone in the best condition from the highest-rated seller fulfilled by Amazon. The phone arrived in blank packaging with a charging cable. It looks like there is a screen protector installed, plus there was a plastic film on top of the screen for packaging. It came half charged. The phone itself looks brand new. No detectable blemishes or signs of use. Hinge is nice and solid. Full charge was very fast (with fast charger). Setup fairly easy with Samsung transfer app but I am still missing a few passwords and accounts. I can manually add those later. There is a lot of bloatware from Samsung, plus carrier junk apps. (I think this is carrier unlocked- when I put my SIM it, it applied my carrier settings and apps.) Battery life (as expected-lots of info on this) is not great. I knew that going in. I am tracking battery usage throughout the day with different levels of use- screen open and closed, dormant or playing videos - and it seems as though this particular device doesn't deplete battery any more than would be typical for a phone this age. I suspect this particular phone was very gently used to begin with. Example: battery depleted about 10-15% overnight with no use, not plugged in. With heavier usage the battery use goes up to about 10% per hour. Not sure if there's anything I can adjust/disable to make this more efficient. My old phone would give me 1.5 to 2 days of a charge with regular use so this will be an adjustment. The screen is beautiful and easy to see. Samsung is an upgrade overall for me and I am pleased with how smooth it runs. Nice on-screen keyboard, etc. I am not tech savvy so there are probably too many customization options for me personally. I really just want a phone that works well for calls, that I can text on and use internet and maps periodically. This should do the job just fine. No SD storage and no headphone jack. I guess that's becoming customary. The device doesn't seem flimsy at all. That being said, I would get a case ASAP in the event of inadvertent drops - it happens. Signal and connection seem good, as does speaker quality. The fingerprint sensor is on the side near the volume buttons. Not sure I am crazy about this placement and it never registers the first time for me, but I think that's probably a user (me) problem. Overall I had a very good experience buying Renewed. Anyone who is interested in trying a flip smartphone, this is very economical option without a major commitment. I will update my review accordingly if, within 90 days, anything goes haywire on the device.",5.0,https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-Flip-Version-Graphite/dp/B0BKTWLR31/ref=sr_1_110?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.qNIx57btdigk7s-mUMFUobuAO57swX8T0jH6ivWxbg3qxKp2kE--JlgCh6bAA0tjya2MPMWYeWO7sqee5OvY4kEHYw4VuKDKtAk24cat8a40RkhYipj_QQrhVDlBSkhzl_h0GC9HgeLDFJv7xXfzDX53SkXpTvH74mJqAhe1TKsdoyQj3goCDER38gXeh6w42mTu7D5UfC9leoBlhozLbA5OSBAo3gH5he-SeYf_pVNKZ9MlMum8p1HhOue7TGaIXQO6H3XVr0FiZB2HsjXmSaPIUYZZgg34IPmNinDH6SI.XK11Kcl-WiM3o53GKBpm19Sn8CK-QLGWH7R29_FoGuU&dib_tag=se&qid=1769857449&refinements=p_123%3A46655&rnid=85457740011&s=wireless&sr=1-110&xpid=FEes0W8Q3djsz,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51StKP-zAWL._AC_SY300_SX300_QL70_ML2_.jpg,Samsung,Android,8,Snapdragon,2.75,128,6.7,1440 x 2560,120,Galaxy Z Flip 4,187.11,57%,3.8,en

Its last year's phone. The Razr 2023 is only $599 (cheaper on sale) and nearly identical. Or get a new Razr+ 2023 or Flip 5 instead. Battery life sucks on flip phones, so eliminating some of the battery usage going new instead of renewed is almost a necessity. Even if you go new, I'd still recommend getting a portable battery, like one that hangs off the USB-C port unless you plan on leaving the phone charging all day. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I did not realize the Flip 4's screen is very soft plastic. I knew it was soft but I didn't think it was that soft. The one I received had a dent in it. Contacted seller and they gave me a $25 refund so I chose that since the dent wasn't that bad and I'll probably get used to it. I didn't want to return + repurchase and gamble. The outside notification screen is nice and serves its purpose. I installed GoodLock from the Samsung store and the MultiStar extension so I could use apps, mainly calculator, Spotify, Pandora, and Samsung Wallet (tap to pay) with the screen closed.  Using full apps (as opposed to the cover widgets) on the cover screen is a gimmick I probably won't use that often, but its nice to have that option. Sound quality of the speaker + earpiece (can do stereo) isn't as good as an S21, S21FE, or newer. Even my S10 Lite has better sound than the Flip 4, but that was expected due to small speaker and small earpiece. Battery health measured at 3595mAh out of 3700mAh (97%) and Amazon only requires 80% battery life. Although battery life is 97%, the battery life is abysmal , losing about 10% per hour while using the phone. I'll probably purchase a 5000mAh or higher hang off the USB-C port battery pack if I notice battery life is too low. Wireless charging is slow. It gets even slower when the phone is in use, like if you're watching something or listening to music.",4.0,https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-Flip-Version-Graphite/dp/B0BKTWLR31/ref=sr_1_110?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.qNIx57btdigk7s-mUMFUobuAO57swX8T0jH6ivWxbg3qxKp2kE--JlgCh6bAA0tjya2MPMWYeWO7sqee5OvY4kEHYw4VuKDKtAk24cat8a40RkhYipj_QQrhVDlBSkhzl_h0GC9HgeLDFJv7xXfzDX53SkXpTvH74mJqAhe1TKsdoyQj3goCDER38gXeh6w42mTu7D5UfC9leoBlhozLbA5OSBAo3gH5he-SeYf_pVNKZ9MlMum8p1HhOue7TGaIXQO6H3XVr0FiZB2HsjXmSaPIUYZZgg34IPmNinDH6SI.XK11Kcl-WiM3o53GKBpm19Sn8CK-QLGWH7R29_FoGuU&dib_tag=se&qid=1769857449&refinements=p_123%3A46655&rnid=85457740011&s=wireless&sr=1-110&xpid=FEes0W8Q3djsz,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51StKP-zAWL._AC_SY300_SX300_QL70_ML2_.jpg,Samsung,Android,8,Snapdragon,2.75,128,6.7,1440 x 2560,120,Galaxy Z Flip 4,187.11,12%,3.8,en

The color is beautiful and matches what is shown online. The phone was very responsive and quick for multiple tasks, it even worked well on Genshin Impact (the game) besides getting a little on the warm side. I paid $299.99 (plus $18.00 tax totaling $317.99) June 22 2024. The phones screen started peeling and shortly after turning into a black line 8-9 months of ownership. As of today, ~16 months of ownership the black line grew to cover ~1 inch varying in size across the middle of the screen. (The progression of the peeling over ~7-8 months) The black line and above no longer responds to touch, only can see display above the black line. Under the black line works as it should. The touch screen not working on the top was discovered as of yesterday. I'm not sure of how many total reports there have been of this model of phone but with my experiences I would consider a different phone and perhaps avoid all of the Galaxy Z Flip or Fold phones. If you do consider to buy a Flip or Fold phone and expect it to last quite a bit longer than the warranty, while still being reliable, I highly advise to do your research. Sharing the steps I've taken so far... I've contacted Amazon. Seems they cant do much as its after a year of when I'm reporting this. I left a voicemail to Chubbiestech, the seller, to see what they can do. I will give Samsung a try as well as this problem is from a design flaw, not wear and tear. I also taken multiple pictures and a video of the phone and the phone case purchased for the phone to show the condition of the phone (phone looks brand new besides the screen where it is peeling and some finger prints on the sides) I would post the video however it is too big in size. The pictures shown are the phone along with the phone case. The case is scratched up a bit on the bottom left corner, however this only caused a cosmetic flaw to the case purchased separately for the phone. The case did its job protecting the phone for normal use excluding drops as the phone has never been dropped on hard surfaces.

I was able to charge the phone after un-boxing so thought nothing of it. The next day I moved the SIM Card, contacts, calendar, pictures, etc.  Afterwards, I thought  I should re-charge the phone.  This time when charging, the phone would cycle off and on as if I had unplugged and re-plugged the charger back into a wall outlet.  Also, I noticed that when I touched the charger it was extremely hot as well.  ""Very HOT."" I grabbed my charger from my personal Samsung phone and the issue went away.  I then put the charger just received with the S23 on my phone and the same thing happed… cycling on and off and extremely hot! I called Amazon and after explaining all the troubleshooting I had completed agreed the charger needed replaced.  They said I would receive an email from “the Seller” as to next step. I received the below…. SELLER REPLIED: Sorry to hear that you’re having issue with charging. Here are some quick-fix you can try: 1. Turn off your phone and check the charging port for any dirt or debris (use a flash light if needed) 2. Use a slim toothpick or sim ejector, gently pick and remove any dirt you saw. 3. You may also try a different outlet / adapter / charging cable to find out if the problem is coming from the accessories. 4. Update the phone may help fix any glitches with the software preventing fast-charging. I then called Amazon back and they contacted the seller who said they couldn’t replace the Adapter itself but that I would have to return the newly received S23 with the defective adapter and they would then send another S23 with a new adapter.  This doesn’t seem a viable solution as I’d spent a large amount of time and effort moving the SIM Card, contacts, calendar, pictures, downloading apps, reestablishing user name and passwords, etc. I resolved to just purchase another charging adapter, but the Amazon associate took it a step farther and resolved the issue thru Amazon and not the seller.

It would not read the SIM or ESIM provided by either company that I tried, and it took weeks and weeks and paying for phone plans through two different phone carriers for a month each paid up front to realize that the phone itself had some kind of flaw.  Both companies spent hours with me on the phone, trying repeatedly to get the phone I bought to talk to their system, as it was showing as compatible, but the phone itself kept saying to insert a SIM card, even though I tried three different physical SIM cards, , plus downloaded ESims from each company, and it just kept saying insert a SiM card.  Hundreds of dollars down the drain, plus an extra hundred in useless phone plans, and no way of finding out that it is actually a bad phone until it is too late to make a complaint, because it takes so long to get a SIM card from a phone company each time.  One of the techs said that it may be a cloned phone or from another country, or locked to a carrier, but sold as unlocked, but that they really had no idea what was wrong with it, just that they could find no way to get it to connect and talk to their system. The IMEI number loaded into it said that it was compatible each time, when they typed the number into their system, but when they tried to connect with an ESIM to get around the fact that the phone won't read a SIMP card, they got a message back saying that the phone was locked to a different carrier.

They got it almost a month ago and it said I'd get the refund by the 20th of May, then it got delayed to 1st of June, now its estimated to give me the refund in the middle of June. If the seller reaches out to me or processes the refund faster, I will update my review based on customer service, because I understand mistakes can happen. I am still paying for this one even though it is not in my possession anymore, so I would really appreciate a refund. The refurbished phone had the wrong screen installed, resulting in certain functions not working such as the biometrics (fingerprint) scanner not working, and resolution and color did not seem right.",1.0,https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-Version-128GB-Black/dp/B0CRPQ8W8X/ref=sr_1_31?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.WK2dYbm7jqrYKzvA_635ffkLZ3yoSlXjjiBx3F0R20HmsmtMFXl5utBxuLtzl5LveVauZfgCiFE7SxRMserK_1mgHMXXPPVUGcdDXZefKQAsIrY-Wm-zLAyyvl1RkJ3o8bA9BQVQYNzoSdchdumoieYo8XyNiGl0Ajq2xITovIuQw9ki618C47OutM78aRW8A65JU5yHaXfWM36FP9oaIgFm2Hfombm727J5m8MN8YN4gyH9BWu8gMnNPt6MyB36UuVFV-wolI2QNcAH0A7Sa2L8RBoPeK0PPOsbJQdJssY.tkVezDMD8UzL1KpR_5lMSbbNxFiCNpZmG59J9O5Yy0A&dib_tag=se&qid=1769857421&refinements=p_123%3A46655&rnid=85457740011&s=wireless&sr=1-31&xpid=FEes0W8Q3djsz,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51l6YHB2x4L._AC_SY300_SX300_QL70_ML2_.jpg,Samsung,Android,8,Snapdragon,2.8,128,6.4,2340 x 1080,120,Samsung Galaxy S23 FE,209.79,9%,4.3,en
