    "review-text": "I was hesitant to upgrade my trusty S10 but it was my birthday and I was feeling saucy. For the price and the various reviews I read, this is THE bang for the buck. Compared to a S24, S25 or S26 there isn't much missing and some would argue it's one of the last of the breed especially with the BT S-Pen (the new ones don't have anymore or have lesser features). It STILL has \"updates\" life left and WILL get One UI 8.5 (any day now actually). This is noticeably faster and better in pretty much every way. I didn't know what real battery life was until now. I can go a full day without a charge; my other phone I was lucky to get 4 hours of my normal use and even then I was on high alert to where the nearest AC plug is. To go from 80% to 50% was scary but that 50% to 20% when the S10 would power down to safe mode was a constant source of anxiety. With this it's like time is on a different measure. I could watch the % tick down on the old one, on here it barely moves. A true game changer. The ONLY \"gripe\" I have is this beast is a big-boy. It's probably double the weight and dimensions in every way. I can absolutely feel it in my front pocket and if I wear my PJs it will pull the pocket down even. Due to that weight it will also pull the suction cup mount off the windshield of the car more often than not so I had to switch to a cup-holder style that's more secure. It is curious why Samsung didn't let it wireless charge their own Galaxy Watch Ultra (when I try the watch says it's \"not compatible\" when I thought it is just Qi charging?) That's a real shame; not huge as the watch lasts a couple days as it is, but would have been a nice-to-have given it's all their same flagship stuff from the same time-frame even... I thought I'd miss not having an SD slot (and kind of do in a way) but I went from 256GB to 512GB internal now. Similarly I used to have the ol' Bixby button on the S10 commandeered to launch Home Assistant. I thought I'd miss that, but literally last night I discovered that the \"RegiStar\" plugin to Samsung's \"Good Lock\" (yeah dumb name) has the ability to assign all kinds of things to all kinds of other things. So now my main power button long-press launches Home Assistant. BOOM! Overall \"no ragrets\" and almost wish I'd done it sooner.",
