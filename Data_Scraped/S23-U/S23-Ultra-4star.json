    "review-text": "The phone works as a S23 ultra should, screen works as it should, speakers, microphone, signal doesnt Drop and battery life is decent. The reason for 4 stars is because even though the phone is factory unlocked it has alot of AT&T bloatware on it. Whenever the phone is starting and powering off AT&T bloatware is there. Ive had to disable AT&T apps because I live outside the US where that network isnt available. So I fully expected a fully unlocked phone and not one from AT&T. The phone still works with my carrier but it would be awesome to be fully unlocked.",

    "review-text": "So far great. Only issue is problems reading my thumb print for biometrics. But I was trying to be budget friendly and had purchased a galaxy a16. This is a vast upgrade. I mean the a16 sucks so bad that I purchased this phone after having the a16 for about 2 months.  I couldn't do it. My phone prior to the a16 gave me a good 3-4 yr run but stopped charging. Summary: The galaxy s23 ultra is great and this refurbished phone is in great condition.",
