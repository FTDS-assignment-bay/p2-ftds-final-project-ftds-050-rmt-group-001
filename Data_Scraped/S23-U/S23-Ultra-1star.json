    "review-text": "I purchased this Galaxy S23 Ultra from Big Box LLC on June 17, 2025, based on the listing clearly stating the device was “Factory Unlocked.” That turned out to be false. 📅 Timeline of What Happened: June 17 – Order placed and shipped same day. June 18 – Inserted SIM and discovered the phone was locked to AT&T. June 19–20 – AT&T confirmed the device was under an unpaid installment plan and ineligible for unlocking. The seller provided an incorrect unlock code, which they later admitted was missing a digit. After multiple failed attempts, the device became MCK locked — a high-level lock that makes the phone completely unusable. I spent over a week trying to get a valid unlock or MCK code from the seller. They kept stalling. June 28 – Seller admitted they couldn’t obtain the MCK code and instructed me to return the phone. ⚠️ Why This Matters: A factory unlocked phone should never require an unlock code — and certainly not end up MCK locked. I made 8 trips between T-Mobile and AT&T trying to resolve this. I lost 15+ hours of professional time, and the phone was bricked because of the seller’s incorrect information. After all of this, the only resolution was to return the phone — which I did under protest, with the entire incident documented. I’m grateful that Amazon support has been helpful and professional, but buyers should be extremely cautious with this seller. A device tied to a financing plan should never be sold as “factory unlocked.” If your time and peace of mind are valuable, look elsewhere.",

    "review-text": "Would give this 0 if possible, but it does gain 1 because it does mostly work in a T-Mobile dense metro area. Either the refurbishing failed to remove all AT&T crapware, or Samsung was incompetent and allowed some hidden AT&T configuration. This was supposed to be identical as unlocked, to the T-Mobile refurbished unlocked that I bought for my wife. There are many places within the area bounded by LA along I-10 to El Paso, up I-25 to Cheyenne; Barstow along I-40 to Oklahoma City then I-44 to Saint Louis, following up through Toledo to Ypsilanti, back west along I-80 to San Francisco, and down I-5 to Barstow, through Yuma toTucson. Along the western edge of Nevada from Las Vegas to Reno, Flagstaff up through Central Utah to Idaho. Both phones show identical configuration, and icons, but this POS refuses to connect to data services when the other one will. Voice support appears to be identical. As far as I can tell, the only difference between the phones is the original vendor, which should have been erased during the unlocking refurbishing. I waited to report because early-on I thought it might have been build-out because the other one was inconsistent. For the last 4000 miles, the other one works and this one fails.",

The guy says to me that it isn’t compatible with 5g network meaning the out parts from an older phone in it. Some of the apps came up with Canada as the location. There was cell bars with absolutely no sim cards in it or digitally in it. But it was transmitting. He said that’s how they can steal all your information once you switch to the new phone. Sounded pretty nefarious to me. He also informed me of amazons third party sellers for these refurbished phones and how they are so much cheaper bc of all the corners they cut refurbishing them. Stay away from anyone that isn’t an actual retailer of Samsung galaxy’s I’m currently checking out Best Buy and checking out Samsungs website for one. They are pricier for sure. But you know you are getting the phone you actually want that’s what it says it is. NOT 5G!!!!!! NOT U.S. VERSION! I’m so disappointed!",
