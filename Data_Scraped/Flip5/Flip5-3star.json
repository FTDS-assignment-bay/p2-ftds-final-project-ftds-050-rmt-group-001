    "review-text": "This is my dream phone so I rushed into buying it. There was a crack in the screen but it works fine. I'm an Apple user so I'm still adjusting. Personally, not worth $400 (with taxes), it should be less. I haven't put a SIM card in yet but it works with all serviced in the US and can take both SIM and eSIM. The Face ID unlock and Touch ID work great and the phone is overall in good shape besides the crack in the screen. Don't get it if you are looking for a perfect phone but it works as a burner phone and actually fits in girl's pockets. Easy to connect to WiFi. Lavender color is cute but get a clear case.",

    "review-text": "Well I purchased the Galaxy Z 5 flip and was refurbished in excellent condition. I really enjoyed this phone until 5 months later my screen completely blacked out, I can only use the small screen now. I have been very careful with this phone and took great care of the phone so I don't understand why the phone screen just blacked out like that. Now I have to buy a whole new phone because it only had a 90 day returned window which is over. I will definitely not buy from them again. I just went a head and ordered an unlocked Galaxy Z 6 flip to replace this phone but this time I paid the $200 for the two year protection because apparently these phone are known to have this problem and buying the lastest model has better chances of not being constantly flipped open. It says these phones can be flipped open 200,000 times or last 10 years 🤣😂 mine lasted not even 5 months. So if you buy this phone even though its an extra $200, definitely buy the protection. If I would've bought the protection for $200 then I definitely wouldn't have been  spending almost $1000 as of yesterday for a new phone and protection. Do not buy this phone without the two year protection warranty. They also have a protection plan for $9.99 a month of you can afford the $200 for two years. Your carrier will not replace an unlocked phone that you add to your plan unless you buy it directly from them. So the two year protection is definitely worth it unless you like spending another $1000 after spending $600 on a phone in a 5 months period. That's $1600 I have spent on phones in 5 months. I really wish I knew I could buy the two year protection in the first place and that I would need it with this phone, it would've saved me $1000. That's why I'm telling whoever reads this, please buy the two year protection they offer on electronics.",
