    "review-text": "HORRID SELLER, Fantastic phone. My phone started malfunctioning within a month, but seller refused to honor the Amazon Renewed Warranty. Fantastic phone, When I had to reluctantly, suddenly & unexpectedly upgrade my zflip 3 to a zflip 5 Renewed was my only option. I'm cost conscious & purchase most of my electronics from Amazon Renewed & have have been a very satisfied customer for around a decade.  This was the 1st time I've encountered an untrustworthy seller. Basically they said \"You received a product & that's the only thing we guarantee. Your case is closed\" I'm quite impressed with how useful the outer screen is. We couldn't hold full conversations through text with the zflip 3 so this new upgrade was a fantastic surprise. I got the zflip 3 simply for aesthetics, but I've been thrilled with how useful this line is which is why I'd  decided to only purchase flips from now on.",

Came with no scratches, was easy to setup, screen was in perfect condition and overall the phone is a 10/10 for me. Make sure to get a screen protecter as well to add extra protection!! I been using the phone for about a week now and it is just chefs kiss lol. I will update my review after a month ;))",

    "review-text": "This phone is very cool phone. My wife loves it. She loves it because it folds of course. The build quality again of course top teir its samsung after all. The gorilla glass victus 2 gives you the glass protection you need. The build of the phone top teir the aluminum body of the phone makes it light and strong. The hinge is very strong as well compared to the moto razr that is made out of steel. The z flip 5 has the latest chipset. It is flawless butter smooth scrolling speed. The screen becoms very bright. The camera is what you would expect from samsung would be awsome it had the 23 ultra camera but because of the size of the phone it would very goofy with those big camera circles like the 23 ultra or the iphone 14 or15. The features are not gimmicky my wife loves tpee mode it is super cool my wife uses it all the time. I just wish you could do everything on the front screen as you could with the phone open. The 1 major downside to this phone is the battery life it is not very good other than that it is an all around really fun and durable phone to use. I would recommend this phone becasue as i said before its fun to use it is a durable phone it packs all latest processing speed strength pretty good camera and build quality. If you are looking for a folding phone with all the latest and greatest. If you want a folding that you can use and not be so limited on its capabilities this is the phone. The zfold is i think not functioning the tablet screen is i believe to much. Most people would not open the phone too often its there if you want but in day to day use its not usable i think and also that phone is super heavy who wants that and the front screen is too narrow. The razr is made from plastic body and steel hindge makes it heavy as well. The google fold is small i think and to wide. The zflip 5 is everything you would want in a foldable. Usefulness screen size is perfect when its folded when open screen is not narrow and odd looking. Not a heavy phone. The gap when folded is completely from 1 end to the other so there will not be any unexpected unfold. For the price here its a steal and amazon provides a pretty good buy back program if you have unused samsung phones or want to upgrade its a great opportunity to get rid of phones to get nice money off of this phone more than it already is. Overall i would get this phone there are way more positive things than negative.",
