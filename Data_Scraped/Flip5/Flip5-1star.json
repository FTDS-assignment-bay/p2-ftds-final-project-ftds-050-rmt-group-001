The phone would turn on and the outside screen worked, however, the entire inside screen went black all of the sudden and wouldn’t work at all despite trying to reset it. There’s no evident reason for why it stopped working, I didn’t drop it or anything like that. I was advised by a phone repair store to return it since the repair was going to cost more than I originally spent on the phone as I would have to completely replace the screen. After returning it, the company refused to refund me stating that the phone was damaged which is the whole reason why I was returning it in the first place as it was in the condition that I had received it in. There’s no physical damage to the phone at all, just that the screen wouldn’t work. Not happy at all with this product nor the customer service I received and would not recommend buying from this seller.",
