    "review-text": "This phone wad something I was very excited to receive when I first purchased it. As soon as I got it I noticed that the sides are kind of flimsy and the crease is extremely noticeable but I never really cared much about the crease. The functionality of the phone is good, I've had no issues whatsoever so far. If you dont like how the phone has a screen on the back then this might not be the phone for you! The condition of the phone itself when it arrived was good, it's important to note to be gentle with the front of the phone as it could get damaged with opening and closing it. Sound quality was just fine as was everything else. Overall I think it's a good purchase.",

    "review-text": "Note: An earlier version of this review erroneously referred to the phone as a Z Fold 5, when in fact this was a Z Flip 5. There was one tiny problem with the device when I got it. A piece of rubber was sticking out of the side by the hinge in a way it wasn't supposed to, and I couldn't put it back. It did not seem to hinder use of the phone so I never bothered to report it, but given the 'excellent' condition it was supposed to be in I expected better. But the phone was otherwise pristine and has been working a charm ever since I got it. Phone is on par with all other flagship Android devices of the era, but does suffer from subpar battery life and only ALMOST stellar camera lenses. But if you love Samsung Galaxy smartphones and don't mind its limitations, and don't mind small QA issues, then getting an Amazon Renewed Z Flip is the way to go!",

    "review-text": "I got this phone refurbished for 500 dollars after getting bored of an iPhone 12 Pro. Battery life gets me through the entire day with 50% remaining, but if I don't reboot it after a while it drains nearly all the battery in a day. The flipping is awesome. Cover screen quality is good, if a little low resolution, but it's not too noticeable. Inner screen is great. Hinge has a bit of play but nothing major. The sides where the hinge is has a weird little ribbon thingy that gets a little annoying sometimes. Face recognition is a joke, might as well not have it at all. Fingerprint reader is perfect. Cameras are just okay. They chose an ultra wide lens instead of a telephoto for whatever reason. I never use ultra wide, but I use zoom a LOT. The 1x lens is fine but low light sucks. I am glad I got this below its 1000 price point because I would have hated to spend this much. Will probably be going back to a slab for my next phone. Never Apple again though, iOS sucks.",

Refurbished in \"excellent\" condition for less than $600, what a deal! I thought \"excellent\" condition meant maybe there'd be some scratches on the phone or maybe like some minor cosmetic damage to the sides of the phone. I received a phone with a crack along the entire width of the inner screen just above the crease. So not exactly the \"excellent\" condition that I had expected. That is my only complaint, though. Shipping: FAST Cost: Reasonable Value: Great Overall score: 4 out of 5 stars. I would subtract 2 points for the cracked screen (making the score a 2 out of 5 stars), but the phone is still fully usable.",
