    "review-text": "Bought this phone and it worked just fine for about 2 months and then suddenly after a samsung update it says that my carrier won't work with this phone although I bought it unlocked. What this company does is get old phones and refurbish them after being attached to other people's numbers and carrier, making it possible to be locked again to the person buying it through them...I would do research on this before buying. Although mine worked perfectly fine and so can yours, it has a high chance of getting locked again after a while or if a update is installed in your phone. The thing with these phones is even if you wipe and unlock them, it will ALWAYS be attached to the original person thay bought the phone. Funny thing is my 90 day warranty is almost up. If it would have done this after my warranty I would have been stuck with a phone that is useless and it being their fault.",

    "review-text": "Edit: Bought a second one and returned the original z flip 6. Both had deep scratches on the screen and chips on the back. I would avoid any flip phones from Amazon unless they are new.  I am deeply unsatisfied as I paid for a higher tier refurbished yet still had the same issues. It's unacceptable to lie on the condition.  This is my last time buying a used phone on Amazon. Product has constant crashings, slows down due to thermal throttling, and worst of all it had a giant scratch/dent in the bottom right corner! I wouldn't recommend buying an used phone unless it's in very good, like new, or perfect condition. I bought a refurbished –good condition phone and it came with a deep gash on the screen. Screen is nice, and big. Having two screens is a big plus. The battery life is acceptable, not a lot but not little. It's perfect weight for me (has some weight, I don't like super light phones). I would say it's not a good value for the money because replacing the screen costs more than the phone itself. Also, since it's second hand I don't get the discount $200 repair from Samsung.",

    "review-text": "Paid extra for \"excellent quality\". I have only had the phone for about two weeks, I have treated it like a baby, and its already starting to break. I know its not the phone, its the seller. I've bought older versions of this phone, all refurbished off Amazon, and I've always been pleased with the quality, so I feel safe to assume this is the sellers fault. Top centimeter of my phone screen flickers green when I turn my phone on/off. Early signs of a screen failure. After 2 weeks. Now I have to switch all my stuff back to my old phone and wait for a refund to buy a new one. Merry Christmas to me I guess. Samsung phones are fantastic, but I wouldn't trust this seller. Find someone else.",
