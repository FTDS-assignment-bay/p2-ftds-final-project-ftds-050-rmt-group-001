    "review-text": "I've been needing to upgrade my phone and decided to purchase the Galaxy Flip 6 because of the affordable pricing on Amazon Renewed products and because the model android is still fairly new. This is my first Amazon renewed purchase and it went well, will probably buy other electronics this way too. The 90 day return policy gives peace of mind. After extensive comparisons on prices, conditions, availability and seller ratings, I decided on this seller. They had the best pricing for the condition listed. The phone arrived quickly, was well packaged and the phone quality is as described. The camera lens have no damage, the charging port and speakers are clean, main screen is perfect condition. There is one tiny scratch on the cover screen, but it's unnoticeable when the phone is on and doesn't impact function. The hinge does have a dent, which was concerning at first. But after inspection it seemed more cosmetic and doesn't effect the functionality of the phone. Which , to me, speaks to the durability of the phone. After using the phone for about a week, I'm glad I made the purchase and upgrade. Its nice to have the flip phone for making and ending phone calls, the slamming it shut satisfaction! The battery life is still operating at optimal performance for a second hand phone. Good experience with this seller!",

    "review-text": "Pristine. My current phone is a Galaxy S9, it's year 2025 and with pending tariffs, and an outdated camera that has ruined many vacation photos (not to mention dropping the phone in Santorini where it slided down tens of steps), I decided to upgrade. I don't believe in buying full price and I've had great experiences with renewed products. It was delivered to me by FedEx requiring signature. The FedEx delivery driver came to my door, knocked very gently and patiently waited until I could get decent to open the door. Then because I was putting on the screen protectors, I ended up inspecting the phone very carefully and because the Flip is a foldable phone, running the phone to explore the Cover Screen features. The condition is pristine, not a single scratch and the phone runs beautifully. I'm sure my amazement is partially from jumping from an S9 to a Z Flip 6 and not 100% contributable to the seller, however I'm very happy. One thing I want customers to be aware of the phone, and this is not about the seller, I didn't expect the thickness it is once it's folded. As a woman, when I put my S9 in my suit pant pocket, it hinders movement. Also, I'm a motorcycle rider and a slab phone in women's jeans front pockets (they are shallower than men's) is a pain in my butt and my thighs actually push the slab phone out of my front pocket. The big selling point for me for the Flip was the compactness, so the thickness really threw me off. Especially because I thought I'd be able to use Google Maps on the cover screen with my motorcycle mount and car mount but I realize that that is not an option because it's so thick. Nevertheless, the camera is a big jump from my S9 and I plan to keep it. I read on Reddit that even in 3 digit speeds, the phone stays open on a motorcycle so I'll find ways to use it on my motorcycle.",

    "review-text": "Great, Refurbished 2024 512GB like new Galaxy Z Flip6! My idea for buying this phone was to be able to have Energizer video camera feeds on the small cover screen to quickly and easily access my cameras. FYI Amazon sells Energizer video cameras for a very reasonable price. Sadly when I first bought the Flip6, I read in multiple 2024 reviews saying that the cover screen was very limited to running only a handful of very simple apps. Then I upgraded the Flip6's software to Android 16 and also installed all the associated Samsung update software. Still a no go for seeing Energizer camera feeds  on the phone's cover screen. Then I found Samsung's Good Lock app, installed it and in the \"MultiStar tool\", under \"Life Up\", press \" I❤️ Galaxy Foldable\", then \"Launcher Widget\", I quickly found that I could easily put ANY phone app on the cover screen, including the Energizer camera app. I can NOW get live Energizer camera video and audio feeds on the Flip6's cover screen! I can also easily and remotely physically move the Energizer Pan/Tilt camera's motorized view positioning system from the cover screen. Please see my pictures. Originally when first released  in 2024, the Flip6 got many poor reviews for the number and quality of apps able to be running on the cover screen. Another bonus, when I log in to Energizer camera feed on the top screen, then when I open the flip phone the Energizer camera feed is displayed full screen!! I was able in early Dec. 2025 to get a 512GB Flip6 in like new condition from Amazon for only $416!!! ?? Absolutely awesome! Thank you Amazon!",

The color is correct; the phone type is correct; the storage size is correct, too! I did notice, however, that the Samsung-provided protective screen is not on the phone. I’ll keep an eye on the battery as time passes because the phone dropped from 53% to 45% during set up. I’m unsure if that’s normal or not… Either way, the phone works perfectly fine!

    "a-size-base": "I bought my phone from TECH EXCHANGEE. The phone arrived on time (today [12/16/2025] was the expected delivery date), and in absolutely pristine condition! If not for the scratches near the left side of the hinge, you would think this phone is brand new! It turns on lightning fast. The color is correct; the phone type is correct; the storage size is correct, too! I did notice, however, that the Samsung-provided protective screen is not on the phone. I’ll keep an eye on the battery as time passes because the phone dropped from 53% to 45% during set up. I’m unsure if that’s normal or not… Either way, the phone works perfectly fine! ADDING: I’ve been using it for 3 days now, and the battery is phenomal! Thank you, Tech Exchangee! Happy holidays to all who read this!",

    "review-text": "I bought the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 for my daughter, and it turned out to be an excellent choice. The condition was very good, almost like a new. The foldable design is a big hit - she loves how compact it is and how easy it fits into a pocket or small bag. The screen is bright and smooth, the camera takes great photos. Overall, she’s very happy with it, and I’m glad I chose this model. The funny thing was that my wife told me that she wants the same for her birthday (she has iPhone16). Recommend.",
