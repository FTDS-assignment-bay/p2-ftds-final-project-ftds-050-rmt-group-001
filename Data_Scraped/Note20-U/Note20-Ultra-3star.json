    "review-text": "I bought this phone looking for something nice, yet affordable. When I bought this my expectations were high and when received is when the problem started. Right out the box the phone had a busted up charger port. It worked at certain angles but still had issues. That would've been fine if it wasn't for the fact when I booted up it was said to be unlocked but came up with the at&t logo but even weirder is when I registered the phone with samsung it comes up with Verizon. I've contacted all 3 companies now trying to unlock the phone but no luck if it wasn't for the fact I use straight talk which works with all carriers I would be more upset by this. The phone condition was amazing not even a scratch which is good but the s pen came broken in 2, in which the seller partially reimbursed me for, still a disappointing out come. Now over a year later this phone has been un usable the screen won't turn on nothing ice treated this phone with nothing but care. Worst seller in the world and worst phone post",

    "review-text": "The way your Accident Protection Plan works is very inconvenient and inefficient. If Asurion has contraced service centers in my area, why not have them do the repairs or service? It seems like common sense that if I can drop my phone off at a place locally that can fix it; they should be able to fix it under the Asurion Accident Protection Plan. Then I should be able to pay the service fee of $39 for a repair rather than $99 for replacement (which actually has hidden fees not mentioned until you process a claim!). The way it is set up now, from what I understand is that I have to have my phone sent into one of your service centers, wait to see if you can fix it, then if not I have to wait for a credit or gift card so I can replace my phone on my own. None of that even tells me how long I would  have to wait for the repair, if possible, or the credit. Why should I have to send my phone in for Asurion to see if they can fix it when there is a place right here that I can take it and have it fixed in 2 hours? The cost of the repair should be covered under the accident protection plan. The service center should be able to provide the repair service that should be covered underneath the accident protection plan. Asurion needs to update the coverage information for purchasers to read disclaimers that the phone must be sent in to one of your service centers instead of bringing it to a place locally. If I have to send my phone in, then Asurion should provide mailing supplies to send it into your service center instead of me having to take a somewhere. This whole thing has been very frustrating and annoying. It does not give me confidence in purchasing any more asurion accident protection plans as here I am with a cracked screen, that can be repaired, and I have no idea how long I would have to be without it in order to get it fixed or replaced. I work remotely and depend on my phone to do my work, therefore cannot be without it for any length of time. That is the reality of the world today. Remote workers and people who need their phones to do their jobs. Asurion needs to update their system to accommodate the way the world is heading or get out of the Accident Protection Plan business. No, I would not recommend your service to anyone, ever again.",

I contacted Samsung and they initially told me $120.00 to repair it.  They changed their mind.  Now they want $300.00 to replace the screen.  That's more then I paid for the phone.  Happy with vendor but not happy with Samsung.  Might switch to the Apple phone I have been avoiding for decades.",

Know that this is common and a way to give you the \"wow\" factor. But also know these are not the original Gorilla glass screens that Samsung installed. These are aftermarket screens affixed by the reseller. I find that they are prone to cracks more quickly compared to Gorilla Glass. While my phone work great, the problem is the camera. Yes, it takes photos, but I cannot do close up photos nor does the auto focus work as it should. If you Google this, this is a known issue. Some people claim if you bang the phone hard enough, it fixes the issue while some just return it. Never ever use the charging adapter/cable that comes with renewed stuff. They are very often the cheapest, unbranded stuff thrown in to satisfy the buyer that they got a charger/cable. I find that some don't work and some charge erratic and slow. They also tend to zap out and become a fire hazard. Stay away from them and use a good charger.",
