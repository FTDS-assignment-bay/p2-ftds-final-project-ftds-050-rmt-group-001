    "review-text": "So...I purchased this phone hoping it was going to be my next LTR, however, it appears this relationship won't make it 6 months. Firstly, the device itself initially appeared great. Clean, shiny and new (used), IMO 8/10. It's been roughly about a month and I do like the phone, it's an upgrade from my Note 8 and functions IMO 7/10. In these last few days, however, it's been showing its semi- refurbished side. (I hope to upload pics) This device should have a water tight seal in its construction. This is not the case (no pun intended), with the back cover coming unglued there is now some separation that I can glide my finger nail through (thick nail). A rainy day will brick this phone. I am perplexed with how bright and vivid the screen is whilst also have some display issues. Maybe it's just me but when I'm streaming and there are darks or deep blacks it just gives you grainy video. Furthermore, as I'm swiping or trying to press on some functions either the touch screen or something doesn't respond to my touch on top sides. Having my finger holding or swiping motion with a picture or file toward the bottom of the screen causes a jitter and sometimes releases my item or causes an undesired selection. These are my main qualms and will look to resolving these issues.",

    "review-text": "I've purchased a few refurbished phones from Amazon and was happy with my first Note 20 Ultra. I decided my whole family should have one as well. Well due unforeseen circumstances, my phone ended up needing to be replaced. So I ordered a new one no problem. Getting the phone was no problem but upon inspection, the excellent status of the phone was put into question. In the upper right-hand corner there was a barely noticeable screen deformity. It wasn't a deal breaker as the phone was still fully functional. But after preforming a usual task while at work, a break point occurred that cracked the screen significantly. I don't pretend to understand the science of gorilla glass but the cracks don't seem normal and it appears that the glas itself was deformed from an incorrect installation that is causing the cracked areas to be raised. Another point of contention comes from the backlighting. It seems to surround all the edges even around the front Camera. Just be cautious when purchasing these phones as they have physical flaws you may not notice at first glance",

    "review-text": "Out of the box it looked like a brand new phone.  Also included was a screen protector that worked better than others that I have tried.  There seems to be a problem with the curved sides of the screen that create problems with these phones, but this one fit and worked better than any others that I have tried. Less than 24 hours after receiving this item, it was giving a black screen and I was unable to do anything with the phone.  After finally getting it to restart by holding the down volume and power buttons for about 30 seconds, it restarted.  Sometimes it took more.  It's difficult to tell if they are being pressed correctly since there is no screen to give any kind of feedback. The Black screen happened several times in the 6 days that I've had it and it is very problematic as I work on the road and not being able to check email, text messages and receive or make calls is very problematic. I have ordered a replacement and will update this review when I receive the new phone.",

    "review-text": "Bought the Note 20 Ultra a few weeks ago. The phone seems to function correctly with 2 exceptions: 1. Reception is at best half of the Galaxy A-50 (cheapy) I've had for years. Not sure if it's because of phone damage or just a weakness of the Note 20 model (which I doubt because of other research). At any rate dead zones increased exponentially with this phone. Streaming is almost impossible when driving... 2. Screen sensitivity is weak as well. When the phone hasn't been used for several minutes it is very difficult to wake the phone up from it's snoozing state. Sometimes I even have to wake it with the PWR button. This phone has lot's of cool features but the reception and sensitivity issues are making me question this purchase. My options seem to be spending a few hundred bucks for a cell booster or a new phone...",

The screen occasionally turns green and pink and I have to restart the phone to get it to go back to normal colors. The worst part is that the seller says they don't have a replacement device to send me so all I can do is return it even though I don't want to I just want a better quality refurb.",

    "review-text": "I bought 2 phones from this seller ; 1 each for both my parents. They work well initially then as soon as the return period elapses, they start malfunctioning. The screen isn't as bright outside, doesn't have adaptable light viewing among othe things. I took them to Samsung only to find out the screens had been replaced with bootleg ones that aren't real Samsung screens 👀😭 I'm editing this review on August 8th 2025 to share the disappointment. I was on a video call with my Mum & the camera was worse than any cheap market phone. Absolutely horrible. Settings are exactly like in my S23 Ultra but camera is really bad & so is the sound. NEVER buying from this seller again. The phone is just not working.",
