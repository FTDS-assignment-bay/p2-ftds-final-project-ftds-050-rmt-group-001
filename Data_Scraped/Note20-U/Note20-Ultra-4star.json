    "review-text": "The phones are Renewed, which means there are multiple sellers and multiple conditions for the phones to arrive in.  When reading the reviews I noticed there are some issues that show up often. I bought from two, since the 1st had defects that shouldn't be in a phone listed as Excellent condition. I ordered a replacement, from a different seller, and have been happy. Putting the two experiences together, I came up with the 4-star review. These are the defects with the 1st phone I ordered. I got an incorrect display, which was too small with rounded corners and it didn't reach the sides or bottom of the screen. The back plate was loose on arrival, but that was mostly an inconvenience because I always use a case. Although, when I took off the case to return the phone, the back had separated from the body. The charging port had not been checked and cleaned out, meaning charging cords wouldn't connect correctly, so it would randomly stop charging. That was a rather simple issue to fix myself. I just shouldn't have had to with an Excellent condition phone. The main issue, and reason for the return, was that the phone didn't properly receive signal. With it constantly dropping calls and losing signal while sitting on a desk untouched, I couldn't use it as a phone.",

Due to its age, however, it's not eligible for the latest version of Android. I can live with that as a tradeoff for the high resolution screen and impressive camera. It's quick, too, with good battery life. If you're going to get one, your best buy will probably be an unlocked Open Box (not used). I put a micro SD card in mine (1GB), and it has a stylus, if you're into that. It's sturdy, but I recommend getting a case immediately.",

    "review-text": "I had thus exact same model phone for almost 3yrs. It still worked perfectly and I loved it but unfortunately I dropped it just the perfectly wrong way and destroyed the led screen. The phone was no longer usable. So I liked it so much I decided to buy the exact same phone. Over 300.00 for a refurbished model. I get it and first of all none of my pictures would sync. They all tried to but they all are just completely black. There are many other things that were different. Maybe due to software updates. When I first got it I thought it was defective because it went on for almost 2 days of constantly updating. I was upset but finally it stopped. The facial recognition rarely works and the fingerprint sensor doesn't work at all. I think it has to do with the Glas screen protector but it is specifically designed for a fingerprint sensor but it doesn't work at all. Since I broke the last one I don't want to have it unprotected. Overall I still enjoy this model but there seems to be numerous differences from my last one. It never gets hot. It takes decent pictures and has a lot of features to improve pictures. I don't think it should cost this much but it is a nice model phone. I would recommend it but just wish the biometric options worked better or even at all.",

    "review-text": "First of all, it's a refurbished phone. It arrived completely unlocked without a single blemish on it. I specifically chose this phone because it was the only relatively new model with ALL these features: 1. Memory card slot. I put a 512 GB card in it to make sure I don't run out of space. Almost every major phone company has ditched it. 2. Stylus. Because I do IT work using this phone from time to time, I need the precision of a stylus when selecting files or accounts. 3. UWB. I wanted Ultra Wide Band for some of the new connectivity. Pros: 1. Stylus is very accurate. 2. Good looking display. 3. Camera better than expected. 4. Speed is still great considering it's a 2020 release. 5. It's an Android. Sorry iPhone peeps, but Apple is way to controlling and hides too much. I was an iPhone guy up through 6, but I won't be going back in the foreseeable future. I currently have an iPhone 11 as a tester phone. Cons: 1. I wish the battery lasted longer; however, I do things that tend to burn through battery life. 2. Most of the time I do a screenshot, it also engages the volume level on the screen causing me to retake it too often. 3. The fingerprint scanner needs serious work. This is the most annoying thing about Samsung. My S20 FE was just as bad. I prefer the fingerprint sensor on my Pixel, which is on the back, so much more. The Samsung face recognition does work really well, even in lighting conditions that aren't that great. FYI, I paid $400 for a phone that retailed for $1,300 two years ago. At $400, this thing is FANTASTIC. Another side note, I have about 8 different phones, because I have to do app testing.",
