    "review-text": "This phone is awesome. I got the one in excellent condition and it charges super fast. The battery is good . The graphics are good . It has awesome drawing/note apps and coloring options and the sound is good. The only one thing is it keeps downloading the same update over and over again but my old Samsung phone did the same thing but you can ignore it. Other than that the phone is perfect. It comes with a built in Bluetooth pen and I downloaded the diamond painting app and it’s like a mini sized version of my iPad and pen that I used for that app. I love it.",

    "review-text": "I don't use face recognition so I can't say how well it works, but for the first week at any rate, the on-screen fingerprint reader has been amazingly easy to use.  I don't use my phone super heavy and it's not uncommon to have 70% or more battery when I put it on the wireless charger at night, and it's *significantly* less picky about placement on the wireless charger than the old phone (note 8).  The car has wireless charging and it's also much better charging there; the old one would often not be in the right place and not get any electrons, where this never fails to juice up. I got the Note 20 because it's the last Note (currently) that has an SD card slot; I'm absolutely against some company gouging me hundreds of dollars extra for a 256GB phone when a 512GB SD card is under 50 bucks.  The drawback to that is this phone came with pretty much nothing at all but a charging cable, which isn't really adding any value.  It took me some time to find a way to get the SD card slot open, without their custom tool, because on this phone at least the hole is waaayyyy too small for a paper clip.  I finally unwound the spring from an ink pen, which was small enough and stiff enough to release it.  Seriously leave out the cable that probably everyone in the world has by now and put that tool in!  It's needed for the SIM even without an SD card. Speaking of SIM, moving my line to this phone was trivially simple.  The phone was apparently on T-Mobile previouisly and I'm on Verizon, and everything worked flawlessly right from the phone.  Put the SIM in, turned it on, and followed the instructions.  Done. I got a Note because, well, I've been a Note fanboy since the 4, when my old Droid with the hardware keyboard gave up the ghost, because of the S-Pen.  It's not something I use every day, but when I do use it, there is literally no alternative that works like the S-Pen.  If Samsung ever stops putting that on their phone I'll probably move on to something more affordable. This is my first ever refurb, and this one at least is exactly what one would hope; it physically indistinguishable from a brand new phone.  Even close observation in the light reveals no scratches or blemishes, it hasn't crashed or exhibited any wonky behaviour (knocks on head), and it's significantly snappier than the old one.  That's not just because it has more resources, I think it's because the UI has been tweaked.  For example when scrolling a long list this phone's \"inertia\", how long it scrolls untouched after a flick up or down, is much higher than the old phone, so it's considerably faster to browse by scrolling.  I'm sure other improvements have been made as well, and together they translate into a much more responsive feel. The OS itself is similar to the Note 8, really, but it has even more bloat and unremovable cruft in it.  For exampe there's \"AR\" functionality now, but even though I have nothing AR, and if I do it's highly unlikely I'll use this phone in conjunction with it.  There's an \"AR Zone\" that can't be disabled, can't be removed, can't be told not to nag me with notifications, can't be managed in the slightest.  Seriously Samsung, get off your high horse.  You don't know what I want my phone to do; fine if you want to have that enabled by default, why do I care?  But can't disable it or remove all the massively huge list of permissions?  Want to rub some salt in there for me?  It's also considerably more in-your-face nagging about things; like I haven't figured out how to get it to stop nagging me to save passwords for web sites, as if the last fifteen times I'd change my mind.  Stuff like that isn't helpful, it's obtuse and rude. Migration was a PitA, but that's normal, so I mention it anecdotally.  Samsung's \"Smart Switch\" does make it less than heinously atrocious, but \"Everything\" isn't (everything), and it still took me days to get all my appointments and other things loaded in.  Once I find my browser bookmarks and get them in I'll finally be done.  Least favorite part of getting a new phone is setting the @*&#% up.  I can back up and restore a computer with trivial ease but no phone maker yet is smart enough to do that with a phone.  Pathetic. I considered only four stars because of the missing SD card tool.  Not sure how many folks would be able to figure out how to open it with the hole being about 2/3 the diameter of a paper clip, which is by the way what Verizon recommends using if one can't find the tool.  I have no straight pins so I don't know if they work, but if I did I'd still want to file the point off to be sure I didn't damage anything. But overall a VERY happy camper.  If you like Android it's likely you'll be satisfied with this phone, and if you've never had an S-pen you'll probably be hooked.  lol",

    "review-text": "I ordered an excellent condition Note 20 Ultra in black and it arrived exactly as advertised,  without a scratch.  It is the most beautiful phone I’ve ever owned and I’ve had several dozen phones.  My daily phone is an iPhone 13 Pro Max because of work (Apple Ecosystem) so this phone was to take a break from Apple at times.  I also own a Samsung S20 Ultra so not new to Samsung / Android.  Out of the box I had connection issues with WiFi and cell phone switching.  When I left my house from WiFi into T-Mobile cell service I would get no service.  I then had to reboot  the phone, it would connect to cell service and then the phone would blowup with notifications.  It didn’t happen every time I left the house, was 50/50.  It also had issues with lag like it was out of memory.  Opening YouTube for example I’d get the spinning ball.  Checking for software update or cleaning the memory, the color dots wouldn’t even spin.  Then there is the battery (4500 mAh) which was extremely poor.  My best battery day was 3 hours 49 minutes onscreen time with 60hz refresh set.  For comparison my used older S20 Ultra battery (5000 mAh) best day was 9 hours 2 minutes (iPhone, 10 hours 16 minutes).  So I called around and found a Samsung certified store which quoted me $79 for an OEM battery replacement.  I would have totally changed the battery if the phone didn’t have the other issues.  I only used the phone for 4 days and after the second hard reset, I made the decision to return it.  I just sent it back today after receiving it 7 days ago.  Even with the issues, I miss it already.  I don’t miss the battery life and the hiccups but the phone itself was gorgeous (that 1440p screen).  It was no fault of the Amazon seller, someone would have to use the phone for days to detect these issues.",

    "review-text": "I was a little nervous to buy this used phone due to some rough reviews, turns out I didn't need to be as this showed almost zero wear. Several tiny micro scratches around the camera bezel, light scuff line near the bottom portion of the screen, but scuff invisible when using phone. Purchased this aging phone to replace my Note 10 Plus as the 20 Ultra was the last Note series that featured a physical sim card. My work provides an iPhone that I hate, but that iPhone has a physical sim, so I removed the sim from the iPhone and put it in my Note 20. Instant activation and Android bliss. Immediately noticed the performance upgrade from the previous Note, beautiful bright screen. Facial recognition and fingerprint reader massively upgraded from the Note 10. Actually works closer to Apple products, but still not as slick as Apple, but this \"new to me\" Note 20 Ultra is still an \"old phone\" with slightly outdated hardware. Pen is much more responsive than the Note 10 Plus version, no issues with the phone pairing with the pen. Purchased a sweet slim fitting case that has a sliding camera cover for amazing protection.",
