    "review-text": "Wow what a piece of garage. Who in their right mind thought replacing a hardware finger print scanner with some touch screen knock off was a good idea?  Works about 90 % of no.  It pretty much never works. Once on, the phone is slow and sluggish. It's totally bloated with Samsung wear you can't get rid of much of which is running in the background reporting your every move. (don't belive it, install duckduckgo browser and turn on app tracking blocker, see what comes up). My TCL 30V 5g was faster.  Screen touches where the app clearly responds do nothing. Long press for cut / copy / paste is laggy. Camera is Meh at best (considering all the hype). If security is important to you look elsewhere. The lack of a dedicated hardware  fingerprint reader is a deal breaker. This was my first Samsung in a phone going back to 08. It will probably be much last. At least this price, things should actually work. Too many thongs here don't.",

Mostly likely have the same issue, but the 2 options given as solutions were not good. Refund being the other. If replacement arrives and has same problem .
