BUT if you don't have a new enough car that is Android Auto compatible, this phone cannot be used handsfree while driving. It requires the caller to constantly sign in/unlock. (My workaround is to have Google Maps open for every single trip, to keep the phone awake. Huge inconvenience to remember to set up Directions every single drive.) There are whole Reddit threads to how poor this function is on this particular model. This was my third Samsung, but rather than buy a whole new car, for this price I'm going to search for a different brand.",
