    "review-text": "I needed a phone that would connect via BT to my hearing aids.  This model was approved by by hearing aid manufacturer.  I bought a renewed phone to economize on price, and the phone met the description.  I am happy with the performance - very fast compared to my older A51 model.  It is a bit heavier, but the frame is metal vs plastic, so that is expected.  Battery life is very good - easily one full day with a lot of use. The only negative I have is that the fingerprint feature doesn't work well.  I have re-learned the finger print several times and it works at first but then stops recognizing correctly.  So now I swipe up and have it recognize my face - that works perfectly.",

I expected the light scuffs on the body of the phone but there is a hairline scratch on screen that pulls my attention from time to time.  It's not a major scratch,  just slightly annoying.  Everything else was perfect.  The phone runs fast,  has a great picture,  takes great picture quality for my uses,  and the fingerprint reader reads a lot better than my old phone. I wish that I would have looked into the phone a little more.  I was unaware that it didn't come with an aux port.  That's on me but I just want to help prospective buyers. It also doesn't have a microSD expansion slot.",

However, the amazing customer service person at my AT&T store was able to work her magic and get the phone connected to AT&T and the data transfer was easy. I didn't realize how poor the battery on my old phone was until I started using this phone which I need to charge only every other day. Definitely worth the price.",
