The phone was protected in bubble wrap and turned on and worked fine, but the box itself was just paper. -1 star damages to back and camera (Good condition). Everything works and I don't intend to put more scratches as I have a case on the phone, but it was definitely more than expected. +1 star for pre-installed screen protector. It's one of those film screen protectors and I will replace it because I prefer tempered glass, but it's definitely a nice touch and better than nothing for coming out of the box. Set up was super easy and so far connectivity has been perfect.",

    "review-text": "The first phone I received from this seller appeared to be in excellent condition, but it turned out to have a serious problem, that I'm now learning is very common. The phone would work great on WiFi, but would STRUGGLE to maintain service anywhere outside of my house. I would have service about 1/10th of the time, and could NEVER get through a phone call without it dropping, when I could even get through. Although they should have caught this, I can't fully blame the seller (which is why I gave 3 stars for a basically useless phone... which otherwise would be awesome... ya know, if it worked) because this is the 4th phone (3 - S22 Ultra's, 1 - Note 20 Ultra) I've had the exact same issue with over the last 2 years. I ordered a temporary phone to get me through while I return this one and wait for a replacement, so I'll update when I receive the next one... UPDATE: I'm raising my rating to 4 stars. The second phone arrived yesterday and so far it seems to be excellent. If any issues arise with the new phone I'll be sure to come back, but I'm hoping this is the last S22 I'll ever order...",

    "review-text": "Well it’s written that it’s unlocked but it wasn’t. I contacted them and they answered 2-3 days if I remember it correctly. Luckily they gave me the NETWORK PIN CODE. So just to be sure that YOU CONTACT AND ASK THEM FOR IT. But for the value for money, this is WORTH IT! Yes it had some scratches here and there but I don’t mind. It’s just in the sides and bottom of the phone anyway, and I use case so it doesn’t bother me that much. I bought this phone to have another ANDROID phone since I have more faith in android than iPhone (sorry fans), because for me it does more, and I can do more in android. So coming from iPhone mini 12, to S22U, it’s not that easy in size difference. But the phone itself is easy to use. it comes with cord and CHARGER BRICK! It's C to C charger as well! Thank you for that, I got the fast charger out of the box!! I can’t say about durability because from what I know, the phone that has been opened or “renewed” is not as durable as the new one especially when it comes to WATER RESISTANCE. But other than that, I guess this is STILL AN AWESOME SAMSUNG PHONE FOR 2024. Been using it since July. So I can really say it's a good buy. Edit: Sept 2025 now. My phone fell not from so high, usually from my sling bag or from my hand when my nephew's accidentally bump in to me, it got crack on its back. Buuuut still works great. How I deal with it? My case is usually clear since then, because I want to show color or photos behind my phone. So the solution? UPGRADE.... just the color though! Phone works fine so why change?! Hahahaha! Just get a skin! In a span of a year, I made my black phone to BLUE and MINT (GREEN). Currently mint green as of now. 😁",
