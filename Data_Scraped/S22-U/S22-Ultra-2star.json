    "review-text": "I use a Samsung S9 for work applications and have for years. The s9 is obviously old but it worked well so I figured I'd buy a newer version for personal use after my iPhone I had for 8 years finally died. What I was looking for in a phone: [  ] Ability to make calls/texts [  ] A great camera as I am constantly traveling and in nature and I don't like carrying an extra camera [  ] A large interface to view the photos I take. A few details in the beginning -The below issues have been present since getting my phone. I have just now became frustrated enough to write a review. -I have never dropped my phone more than 3ish ft (from hand to ground while sitting or standing), what I'd sat is normal wear/tear. These issues DID exist before, though I don't think dropping an electric ever helps it. I've never gotten my phone wet, too hot, plugged in to a non GFCI protected outlet, or hooked up to another computer where a data transfer cord could have transmitted a virus. -I run a paid VPN and use Firefox and duckduckgo -I live in a very metropolitan area where proximity to my cell providers towers are not an issue -I have a nice case I have had on the phone since purchasing and a screen protector Issues [  ] Answering phone calls: what I feel like happens most often is that when I attempt to answer an incoming call I press the green answer button. Then the  phone will stop ringing and bring up what I'll call the \"in-session call\" screen but it never truly connects. It will stay stuck on this screen with no one able to hear each other for up to a minute. I have talked to people in person (the one I was trying to communicate with) and they will tell me that they were sent to voice-mail. [  ] Placing phone calls: when trying to place phone calls, sometimes my phone will ring once then a recording will tell me the person I am trying to reach is unavailable or the number I am trying to reach is not in service. I knew that these two reasons were not valid before but I had an experience when needing to reach 911 where I was told the number was not in service. I have also verified this by sitting next to people I am trying to call and seeing that the call never goes through. [  ] Microphone crackles if playing outloud or on speaker and will continue making the crackling noise until phone is restarted [  ] Camera is just way less detailed than I thought it would be. I heard great things about the clarity before buying. And, when looking at the physical phone, seeing how many lenses there are on the outside, one would think this phone could produce some quality shots. But every photo I take seems pixelated. I have tried to narrow it down to a specific lens by tweaking zoom and frame but I have located it the fix. This may be a software issue as the lenses aren't scratched [  ] The autocorrect function is pretty lousy. One of the 3 options usually happens: 1, a word that is spelled correctly will be autocorrected to something that doesn't make contextual sense. 2, the correct correction will be made but it will be conjoined with the following word after typing. 3, a word is spelled wrong bybthe operator but autocorrect never pics it up. Funny enough, this example happened while typing the previous sentence. I left it just to provide example and put it into the attached media section on the review. [  ] Screenshots don't always show up immediately in your photos. The photo app may need to be closed out of first and reopened. [  ] Thumb print: huge issue here...it only works about half of the time. I have now just began putting my password in every time. This is a first world complaint, but if it is a function of the phone I bought, it should work more than half of the time. [  ] Trying to place the mouse in a specific place in a paragraph can be a nightmare. The sensitivity and touch technology for the screen seems cheap. I know this isn't the case but it can seem like it will place your mouse everywhere but where you want it. I have similar issues when trying to highlight a specific word/portion in text while making edits. Some good stuff [  ] The screen is very large and crystal clear. Samsung was able to utilize a really large portion of the front screen all the way to the literal edge The phone is great for watching videos [  ] The phone itself is very sleek and good-looking [  ] The battery life is surprisingly good. The lifespan does seem to fluctuate day to day as my usage usually consists of calling and text (no social media). If you reach 5% life though the phone has about 1-2 minutes left, unlike the iPhone which seems to vary. All in all, the first thing I would have done differently is to not buy refurbished. And secondly, in my very narrow experience, I think Apple makes a better product. The security on Apples devices is a HUGE selling point for me as well. I haven't had a security issue with this device, but I have tested the security of other android devices.",

    "review-text": "Read entire review before buying! We bought two of these phones at the same time recently one green and one pink. The pink one works good, I do have a little less service and it sometimes cuts out in areas that every other phone I have had kept full service. I use the same carrier so its not a coverage issue. We spoke to the carrier and they had us replace our Sim cards with new updated ones to make sure that wasnt causing any issues(it wasnt). I like the phone and features so much that its not a huge issue for me, i will be keeping this phone for awhile..... HOWEVER.. the green one does not work for service unless it is on wifi for wifi calling and messages. Once off wifi it says emergency calls only. Its unusable.. I contacted the seller and let them know. It has been several days and I havent heard back from them on anything. These phones are christmas gifts, so I only needed a replacement that works as well as the pink one and I was needing it quickly but I am still having no luck reaching anyone. I contacted Amazon and they are wanting me to return the item and are sending the labels to do so. Phone features, colors, and design-5 stars Phone service, dropped calls- 3 stars Customer service from seller-0 Stars I'm only giving a 2 star rating bcuz the pink phone does work, it does drop calls but its usable and I really like the look, feel in my hand, color, and over all design of the phone. It is very sleek, pretty and was in perfect cosmetic condition, otherwise they would get even less of a rating. Very disappointed at the lack of customer service especially this close to christmas with needing to return and replace a gift. We had decided to return/exchange for the exact same one from the same seller, but with the lack of response we will try and find another seller entirely. Will update review if anything changes or seller contacts me.",

    "review-text": "When the phone arrived, it was in excellent physical condition and looked practically new. Initial setup went smoothly while connected to Wi-Fi, though I did notice the fingerprint reader did not work and the battery drained unusually fast. The real issue became apparent once I left home: the phone would not connect to my carrier’s network at all and showed “No network / Emergency calls only.” I spent over three hours troubleshooting with my carrier (Cricket / AT&T network), and they confirmed the error messages I was receiving only occur with carrier-locked devices. Despite being listed as unlocked, the phone could not be used on my carrier. After a factory reset done during troubleshooting, Wi-Fi calling also stopped working, leaving the phone completely unusable. I reached out to the seller multiple times but did not receive a resolution or confirmation that the device could be unlocked. I understand that refurbished phones can be a gamble, and I’ve had positive experiences purchasing refurbished devices through Amazon in the past. Unfortunately, this one did not match the product description and had to be returned. If you need a phone immediately or do not have a backup device, I would recommend purchasing elsewhere.",

    "review-text": "Not Actually Factory Unlocked. It is a Jailbreak I bought this phone about a year ago, and I have been frustrated from the beginning. It was advertised as “factory unlocked,” but it turns out it’s actually jailbroken, which I only found out recently after talking to an IT tech. That explains everything. Because it’s jailbroken, it’s not truly compatible with my carrier and causes nonstop problems: It won’t switch to 4G when 5G is weak. Wi-Fi calling doesn’t work. Service is terrible even when my husband has perfect signal right beside me (same provider, same plan). The battery drains fast and the phone overheats randomly. App Store updates fail or apps won’t download correctly. Fingerprint scanner fails about 70% of the time. Bluetooth connections drop often or won’t pair right. I keep getting signed out of Hulu for no reason (maybe related, maybe not, but it started when I got this phone). I thought I was buying a reliable, unlocked phone, instead, I’ve dealt with nothing but frustration. It says “unlocked” in the listing, not \"jailbroken.\" Lesson learned the hard way.",

    "review-text": "Updating my review after using the phone more. From four stars to two. The S22 Ultra overheats constantly, even during really simple tasks which I later found out this model is known for that. The battery life is also worse than expected even for a refurbished phone. I also got the wrong color (ordered green, received gray). The phone showed up completely dead, taking 20 minutes of charging to even turn on, and had fingerprints all over the screen, so the presentation was basically non-existent. The only nice surprise was that it came with both a cable and a wall adapter instead of just a cable. The phone works decent for an average user, but the overheating is very annoying. I got this to run heavy tasks with but it seems like that's not going to be a viable option. I paid more for a like-new option and am overall disappointed.",

It was sold as factory unlocked but actually its carrier unlocked (att), but the carrier firmware is so bad that the phones network settings are so messed up. Still trying to flash unlocked firmware on this phone. Horrible in the US and every country I've taken it to with regards to connecting to networks. It was sold as refurbished good and had a few scratches on the screen. Other than that its fine. If you want to know if your phone is actually unlocked turn the phone off and hold the power button and volume down together for 10 seconds. Won't work with T-Mobile in the US. I regret this purchase.",
