    "review-text": "This product seemed perfect at first. I have always bought my phones refurbished and unlocked from Amazon and have never had any issues. The model of the phone itself is awesome and the camera is perfect. Which is a huge reason I went with this model. I was constantly getting compliments on the quality of my photos. I have zero complaints about the phone make/model. It also came to me looking brand new and in excellent condition. The phone seemed to work flawlessly for the first month and half that I had it. I had no issues at all and then one day it just stopped connecting to my network carrier. It worked completely fine until I would leave anywhere that I had wifi and then I would not be able to use my phone as a phone. I wasn't able to send or receive calls or do anything that required internet unless I was connected to wifi. Including google maps when I was trying to navigate somewhere. I tried troubleshooting a bunch of different ways including removing my SIM card and putting it back in, and I spent over an hour on the phone with AT&T who told me to clear my cache in my internet browser which seemed to work for about an hour then it would tell me \"No network coverage available\" anytime I tried to do anything. It wasn't my carriers issue because everyone else on my plan had zero coverage issues. I went back and read more of the negative reviews on here and realized I wasn't alone with this issue. Like I said, I'd never had any problems like this before with buying refurbished phones on Amazon. I don't know if this seller is bad, or the device itself just had some computing issues. When I requested an exchange for my phone I was told that they didn't have any more available and that I would have to receive a refund only available on the card that I used to purchase it. I ended up just going to AT&T and buying the new Galaxy S24 Ultra and I LOVE it. Unfortunately this experience has probably ruined my buying refurbished phones for me, and I will probably just end up spending the extra money for a new one from now on.",

    "review-text": "DO NOT PURCHASE THIS MODEL!! THEY ARE FACTORY DEFECTIVE!! DO YOUR RESEARCH AND YOU'LL SEE THIS PHONE SHOULD BE RECALLED!! I really did enjoy this phone while it only lasted for about first six months. Then comes the devastating issues. The Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra 5g was and is being sold with now known manufacturing defects. The internal antenna disconnects unreasonably too easy. This phone can't even be dropped from 2-3 ft with a nice case. The antenna broke/came loose inside the phone 3 different times. The first time it just started showing \"Emergency Calls Only\" on the top left of the screen and this 🚫 where 5g should be on the top right side. This happened over 20 times a day, and after driving me insane for a couple days I took the case off and it had a small crack on the lower right side of the back glass. ( I've never had a phone crack inside a case before). So I got the back glass repaired. Then the next day the phone begins doing the same thing again, having no service more time than functioning correctly. So now's the next diagnosis saying the  antenna needs replacing and the  charging port must be replaced with an antenna repair. It worked for about 2 weeks and did the same thing again and there was no accidents or damage done to cause it. By now I'm way too frustrated and take it back and use the warranty of the repair shop. So I bought this phone for about 599.00 in July of 2024 and since then the screen cracked through a screen cover, the back glass broke through a strong case and I've had to get the antenna repaired 2 or 3 times now and now the phone is doing it again. It only lasted 2 weeks and now I can only count on it at home with WiFi. I've got over 1 thousand dollars in a phone that should've been 100% Recalled and Replaced with a different model. I hope it was only this year and this specific model. SADLY this has turned me to really considering going to an iPhone. I also had to change phone carriers(Boost Infinite to Mint mobile) bc at first I didn't think it was the phone causing the problems. And I've bought 10-12 accessories just for this phone. Not counting my Samsung Galaxy Watch and Galaxy Earbuds. This Phone has left me stranded before and now it's just left a devastating aftermath of WASTED MONEY AND TIME!!",

    "review-text": "I have had pretty good success with buying refurbished/renewed phones on Amazon in the past, but this Samsung S22 Ultra is hot garbage.  Everything seemed great the first two months, and then I started having issues connecting to the network, with the phone only working on WiFi. Did all the Samsung \"fixes\" on their support page but nothing worked. Ended up going to a local phone repair shop that changed the antenna at a cost of $80 parts and labor.  That worked for another two months and I just started having issues with network connectivity AGAIN...knowing its eventually going to drop to zero very soon following the previous experience. Im not an electrical engineer, but I am in the maintenance field.  I think this phone has a serious design flaw.  My guess is the battery overheats too much during charging and softens or unsolders the antenna connection over time.  Again, this is my best guess why this phone, and many others I see purchasers complaining about the same issue here are having when it comes to connectivity with networks.  Samsung either really dropped the ball on this model design wise, or purposely made it cheap. Id recommend AVOIDING the Samsung S22 Ultra Edit: I opened the phone and pushed the ribbon cable back into the antenna and it worked again. So that's the issue. Minor bumps or drops cause the ribbon cable to pull free. Im also not ruling out my other theory that the battery expanding as it gets hot also tugs on the cable, as it runs directly over the battery. Again, I'd avoid this model if I were you",

    "review-text": "👎☠️👎👎I bought the \"excellent\" refurbished device, but it wasn't worth paying a few extra dollars. I should have bought the \"acceptable\" one; it would have been the same or better than what I received. Externally, it has noticeable dents on the corners, and there are visible chips. The battery must be at 70 to 80% of its lifespan because it doesn't last even 5 hours when I use it for work. On the other hand, and most importantly, the connectivity doesn't work at all. The first day I got it, I installed the physical SIM, and it took 3 days to recognize the carrier. I spent 3 days without communication and unable to configure apps that require phone number authentication. 🚫🚫 Today marks nearly a month of use, and the connectivity is a disaster. The signal drops unexpectedly. One moment it's fine, I can use mobile data, make calls, etc., but suddenly the signal is gone and I can't connect to the internet or make/receive calls. 🚫🚫 This is consistent; I can't predict when the coverage will drop. On average during the day, I lose communication about 10 times in periods ranging from half an hour to 2 hours. Overall, I feel ripped off; it's the worst purchase I've ever made. 👎☠️👎👎 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 👎☠️👎👎Compré el dispositivo de categoría reacondicionada “excelente”, pero no valió la pena pagar unos dólares más. Hubiera comprado el “aceptable” y habría sida igual o mejor que el que me llegó. Externamente tiene golpes notorios en las esquinas, se notan los despostillado. La batería debe estar entre el 70 y 80% de su vida útil porque no dura ni 5 horas de cuando lo ocupo para trabajar. Por otro lado, y lo más grave, la conectividad no funciona en lo absoluto. El primer día que me llegó instalé el SIM físico y tardó 3 días en reconocer la operadora. Pasé 3 días incomunicado y sin poder configurar las aplicaciones que requieren hacer la autenticación con el número de teléfono. 🚫🚫 Hoy se cumple casi un mes de uso y la conectividad es un desastre. La señal se pierde inesperadamente. Un momento está bien, puedo usar lo datos móviles, hacer llamadas, etc., pero menos pensado se va la señal y no puedo conectarme a internet, ni hacer, ni recibir llamadas. 🚫🚫 Esto es permanente, no puedo estar prevenido de cuando va a irse cobertura. Pero en el día, en promedio me quedo incomunicado 10 veces en lapsos de media hora y 2 horas. En definitiva, me siento estafado, es la peor compra que he hecho en mi vida. 👎☠️👎👎",

    "review-text": "If I could leave a 0 for Samsung I would, Amazons been great btw. I bought this phone September 12, 2024. Carrier coverage worked fantastic, cameras are amazing, still are amazing. Fast forward to February of 2025 thats when my cell coverage would randomly drop after doing an update. I contacted my carrier support, and spent hours troubleshooting, they asked me to check for updates, low and behold I had more updates cross fingers. After doing the updates I now have no cell service. Looked online and there are a lot of S22 Ultras and the newer Samsung phones with the same issue after updates from Samsung. Ive tried two different carriers, all networks Verizon, T-mobile, and ATT nothing except in satuated cell coverages like phoenix it will randomly gain and drop cell service. Ive read the 5g antennas and sim tray board can be faulty from the factory, had a shop change them with no success. Im in contact with Samsung to try and get the phone fixed, they had me go to a shop that said its more than likely the motherboard/mainboard for the phone, we cant fix that it'll have to be sent to Samsung to be fixed. Recontact Samsung and they can't even give me a price on how much its going to cost me to fix their updates screwing up my phone. Really disappointed with Samsung not standing behind their updates and products. I used to love Samsung, i had to move my sim card into my Note 10 plus and it works perfectly no cell issues at all. I will try and update after sending the phone to Samsung. Update 8/12/2025 Soo i sold the phone and bought a Pixel 9pro xl and it works perfectly with my carrier and no issues. I have a friend that has his s22U starting to have issues. My wifes S21U is now having connection issues and I've bought her a Pixel 7 pro. I dont know whats up with Samsung but they need to figure some stuff out. I wont be buying Samsung anymore. I love their camera which is my main point in buying a smart phone. its sad but theyve lost me as a customer.",

    "review-text": "+The phone arrived a day earlier than the shipping prediction indicated (I might not have needed the extra $14 to advance delivery by a day). --->>> 1 month Update: This phone's Data and phone reception is Horrible no matter where I go in the Baltimore metro area!  Comparing side by side with working S-6 and S-7 phones this phone will not detect a Data signal in many urban settings where I could previously make and receive calls, offering the Ø symbol rather than (empty) reception bars. Calls will not come through unless I am on WiFi.  ( Wifi transmissions/receptions frequently completely drops off when moving from room to room in an average size house with 6 WiFi access points. Not so with the S-6 or S-7). ---->> October 4, 2023 Update: The phone refused to take or make calls unless I was almost underneath a  Cell Tower. I took it to Verizon, and they could not evaluate antenna performance. GeekSquad was also unable to evaluate poor connectivity. The phone simply failed to perform basic cell phone duties. (WiFi connectivity was weak also).  And So I took advantage of Verizon's Phone Insurance plan where they gave me a replacement at no cost.  --- In the End, this purchase was not worth it. -- \"Excellent condition\" seems to me should be a just tiny bit shy of new in the box. In my case the metal edge at the top and bottom had the finish worn off, and the phone appears to have suffered a minor drop as there was a noticeable but not deep, depression in the screen and metal rim at the top of the phone. (The screen may be made from a similar material as that for folding phones so that it does not shatter for some drop types) There does not appear to be any diminishment to the screen performance/color-saturation. -- The generic \"C\" charger cable does not easily fit into the phone.  The first time I plugged it in I could not get it to seat so I had to fiddle with it to stay in, wedging the phone to keep it from sliding out. While it showed charging had started it must have come loose shortly after as it did not charge over night. \"C\" connectors are supposed to fit up or down, but this one only snaps fully in one way. [My Samsung S-6' micro-B had failed after two years and so I was not anxious to use force on any USB (I am an experienced systems / tech manager so this isn't a fear of tech thing)].",

    "review-text": "Before Proceeding with this review, Please note that I have contacted Amazon and they are sending me a replacement.  I will update this once the new device comes in and it matches what is posted on Amazon. I received this phone in \"Refurbished - Excellent\" condition, but was not aware of the multiple issues I would have with it.  The first thing I notice was any time the charging cable is plugged in, the phone becomes unstable.  Trying to type is a nightmare and swiping the keyboard in impossible.  The second was the screen.  An actual S22 Ultra has a nice crisp screen where as this one is kind of choppy at 120hz and gets overheated very quickly.  There is a huge border around the screen where the screen should wrap around and be squared off. See the image with the colors to see how it should look.  This is also how my neighbors looks on his S22 Ultra.  These is no note in the description that states the phone will come with a knockoff display.  The display also gets very hot, very quickly, and consumes battery quickly.  In comparison to my neighbors, it handles brightness well and uses much less battery.  Set to the same resolution, brightness and playing the same YouTube video, in 30 minutes, his dropped 4% and mine was hot and dropped 16%.  Finally, being able to compare the phone to a complete real S22 Ultra on the same cellular provider as myself, and living right next door, he has WiFi Calling and 5G, where I do not. *** RED FLAG *** This is listed in the listing as MODEL SM-S908W The phone I was sent is MODEL SM-S908U/DS I expected to receive the SM-S908W as purchased and the correct hardware.  $400 is not a small amount to spend.",

    "review-text": "Do not purchase from seller. We purchased two phones and they came promptly and in nice packaging. The phone itself appears in great condition. One of the phones is working well.  However, one of the phones has an issue with the S Pen failing to connect and the screen flickers, and fades in and out periodically. After doing the usual troubleshooting the phone is still not working properly. We attempted to request a replacement online, but the only option is to request a return. This means you will be without a phone because will have to return it first then order a new one and possibly have a difficult time porting your data over.  Or you have to buy another phone then return the old one, thereby providing a free loan to Amazon and the seller. After calling Amazon we were told the seller doesn't allow for exchanges and a return is only possible. Do not expect Amazon to take any sort of initiative to resolve an issue if you have one. They will only repeat the same thing and they will not contact the seller themselves. They will not attempt to resolve your issue other than tell you to return it. After several phone calls and several representatives of Amazon we were hung up on three different occasions. This whole experience has been terrible!!! I am reaching out to the seller directly.  If they are able to provide a better resolution, this review will be updated.  It's unfortunate that the customer service through Amazon was truly awful.  If they had seamlessly provided a replacement phone, this could have been a great experience and a positive review, despite the issue with the phone.",

    "review-text": "I wanted to upgrade from my S9 Plus for my birthday, and this looked like a good deal. I ordered it, spent the hour or so getting everything in order and put the new case I already bought on it, and the lock button felt a little off. I thought it was because I wasn't used to having all of my buttons on the side of my phone instead of the back, so I ignored it for a while. Until the lock button downright stopped working. Couldn't lock my phone, which is a pain. I had to set my screen shut off to 15 seconds so it would lock itself. I reached out to them for help, or maybe even a credit so I could just go fix it myself and avoid the hassle of returning it and buying a whole new one, but they wanted it returned. Now for the best part. I ordered another one to replace the first one. The second one came in crappy packaging, the phone was dirty with grime on it like it belonged to a teenage boy, sticky stuff around the camera, even the pen was dirty when I took it out. *ew* I tried to brush past it as long as the damn thing worked and there were no scratches on the screen. I got most of the grime off, put it in my case, and started using it. Well guess what? It won't stay connected to any charger cords that I have. If it even moves an inch, it stops charging. So when I have it connected to my car through cord, every bump, it disconnects. Not very fun. Now I have to return this one. I ordered myself a phone off of backmarket for a much better deal, I'll be receiving it soon as well. When I do, I'll be transferring my information for the third time in this lovely adventure and this phone is going to be returned. Thanks for listening to my rant!",
