    "review-text": "Phone arrived on time and in good packaging and as promised it appeared to be in great condition. No scratched screen or noticable flaws to be seen. It had enough charge to fire it up right out of the box but came with a charging cord also (charging box not included) I don't notice anything off at first, or maybe I did but I dismissed the glitchyness as my own doing. Thinking I must be pushing a button or in some other way activating a feature I was not intending to activate. Afterall this was a new device I was getting use to and a very big upgrade to the refurbished galaxy s9 w the very cracked screen running android 10 I was using previously. However it's been some time now and I'm sure that the glitches are not due to my usage or misusage. I have to restart the device about 10 times a day on average because to will randomly decide to not accept my touch commands and will only respond to the s-pen touch/control. This can get very frustrating since the ability to walk around with my little pen out tapping away at the phone screen is not always conducive  to my activities. I have not contacted customer service on this matter yet so I do not know if its a software issue or something. I likey will however be reaching out to them soon and will update my review with further insight if available. Other than the glitch the phone is very nice. The material is sturdy and sleek. The look screams of classic charm and beauty in line with the rest of the Samsung Galaxy family. It's got 5G capabilities and connects easily. Downloads quick  has the Samsung Knox enables for greats security. Large screen so streaming or playing games is great. The sellar shipped it out very quickly and it arrived on time. No issues with shipping. Last but not least (well in this case maybe it is least as well) I did a lot of research before deciding what type of phone to buy, I'm kinda thrift and do not buy things of any significant cost for myself without thoroughly looking into first. Then after I learn what I need to learn I spend a lot more time (and I do mean a lot!!!) searching through different sellers on dozens of sites and apps and stores (online and in person), checking with friends and friends of friends, searching social media......etc....lookibg for the absolute best deal I can find. And wen I look at a deal I factor in every bit of relative detail. Like the storage capacity, memory/ram, connectivity, FRS, refresh rate.....pretty much all the specs that affect the performance and I can say with confidence, if ur looking into the S22 ultra, this is the best deal you will find.",

After some research and so much troubleshooting I discovered this is a common issue with this phone.

    "review-text": "First off, I’m knocking down two stars right away because it didn’t even come with a SIM card removal tool. Took me 7 hours to find something small enough and strong enough to open the tray. That alone had me absolutely irritated and mad — a basic item that should’ve been included. As far as the looks of the phone, it was in rough shape. Major wear and tear on the bottom — the paint looked rubbed off and faded, showing gray instead of black along the bottom bezel. There was some horrible sticker slapped on the back that I still can’t fully remove, no matter how much I scrub. It looked like someone used it hard, slapped a wipe on it, and called it “refurbished.” Battery life? Terrible. My old phone — which had less battery capacity — outlasts this one by hours. So clearly, no real battery replacement was done. It feels like they just cleaned it up with a little rubbing alcohol and shipped it out. As for performance, it gets hot pretty fast and sometimes lags even with basic tasks. And don’t even get me started on the fingerprint reader — works when it wants to, and that's not often. This phone is clearly not “gently used” or “certified refurbished” — it's more like “barely salvaged.” If you're expecting quality control or care in presentation, look elsewhere. This felt like a quick flip with no attention to detail. Highly disappointed.",

    "review-text": "This is probably my favorite Galaxy that I've owned so far. The camera is absolutely amazing. It's lightening fast and never lags, freezes or any of that crap. I definitely recommend a screen protector!!!! because these screens with the curved edges can get REALLY pricey to replace... at one point I was tempted to just buy a whole new phone. Anyway, love the phone!!!! and then all of the sudden...... the screen went black on me for no reason. It wasn't cracked or anything... so i thought, maybe it just died?  i didnt recall the battery being so low though.. well , even the charging circle didnt pop up when i plugged it in, BUT it vibrated. it also vibrated when i pulled the s pen out. ok, so the phone is on.... the screen isn't working... but why? there is no reason for the screen to be black... while attempting to unlock my old s10+ through Samsung mobile i , for whatever reason, clicked play sound to find my s22.. it didnt ring. why?!???! it is enabled to be found.. the location and everything was on. whats going  on? welllllllp. after trouble shooting and symptom checking i discovered that my motherboard is failing. and its a really common problem with the s22 ultra! so my favorite phone.... has a motherboard issue. I just hope i can get all of my data off of it, and i hope that everything is backed up. it flashed on for a few minutes and i synced back ups but I'm not sure it actually finished before the screen blacked out again, or if it continued while blacked out.. anyway, this really really sucks. BEWARE of this issue and if you decide to buy this phone anyway MAKE SURE YOU REGULARLY BACK UP and HAVE AN EXTRA PHONE ON TO USE in case this happens to you.",
