    "review-text": "It's always a gamble buying a phone that's renewed/refurbished, because you hope you're going to get what the seller actually promises (as opposed to a disappointing/broken/non-working product). This isn't my first refurbished phone, but I'm always a little anxious spending the money on something I HOPE is going to be good (as opposed to brand-new/unused). I bought this phone in refurbished/excellent condition. After reading multiple reviews on multiple refurbished phone listings on Amazon, my biggest concern was (always is) getting one with a damaged screen, cameras, or having it not truly be unlocked. I've had this phone less than 24 hours, but here's my take SO far (I can't speak for other people, these are just my experiences): 1) Yes, it was (for me) truly, 100% unlocked. Not even an ex-carrier logo when I first turned it on! (My previous 'unlocked' refurbished phone has a T-Mobile logo when turned on) I was quite happy/impressed about this. 2) No scratches (that I could see) on the front/touchscreen. There are multiple, TINY scuffs on the sides (not part of the touchscreen)/top edge/bottom edge of the phone - which I fully expected w/ a refurbished phone, and I'm totally fine with it (and this is if I'm REALLY nitpicking - they're really not that bad, though. It's just not FLAWLESS, which - again - I'm fine with). 3) 99% flawless on the backside - the ONLY thing I can see is a TINY scuff on the edge of one of the cameras (not the actual camera/glass screen itself), and this is cosmetic - it doesn't affect the quality of the camera (that I've noticed). 4) S-Pen pops out like it should, seems to be fine. 5) Charges just fine so far - both wireless and wired. 6) Popped in my SIM card (US Mobile, uses T-Mobile network), and it worked instantly. No phone/SIM-related problems so far. Everything - and I mean everything (data, wallpapers, photos, Samsung Notes from my previous phone, sounds/ringtones, apps, folders, etc) - transferred from my old phone perfectly (Samsung Smart Switch app). 7) Fingerprint reader works fine for me so far - and that's with a plastic-y (TPU?) screen protector that I put on it. I haven't noticed any real issues thus far - if anything changes, I'll update my review. OVERALL: For me, yes it's definitely worth the money. If you're considering it and you're on the fence (and I understand why you might be), I say go for it. I'm very satisfied, hopefully nothing changes in time. Buying refurbished is a great way (in theory, lol) to save money while still getting a phone you really want (I think they're normally way overpriced anyway). Shipping was great (got mine the next day!), no issues with packaging (very safe/secure), and the phone - while not literally FLAWLESS - still looks great, works great, and I look forward to using it for a long time to come! A great buy overall!",

    "review-text": "I was a little apprehensive spending more on a used phone than I spent on my new OnePlus 6T 4 years ago. I'd done the research and decided on the Galaxy S22 Ultra (mostly for the phone capabilities) but wasn't willing to spend $1200, so I took a chance on a refurb unit. I've had it for a couple days now and I can say it was one of my better purchases. The phone arrived a day early, well packaged, and included the phone(w/37% battery charge), an adaptive fast charger, a cheap usb c charging cable, and sim removal tool. After close inspection, the phone showed no signs of prior ownership. It was in pristine condition just like new. It started right up and I got through the setup process. Being an unlocked phone,I figured I could just throw in my Cricket sim card and be ready to go. Cricket recognized the phone straight away, reminded me to turn on wireless calling, and I was back in business. Now let's get it charged up. I plugged in my OP6T usb c cable and powerpack out of habit and started messing with settings when I ran across the battery settings. It showed 2 hour, 13 minutes until fully charged. Ok, lets try the included charger and cable. I setup the included charging rig and the charging time was reduced to 42 minutes. Sweet!... until it wasn't. With the phone fully charged, I went to unplug the charger only to find it stuck in the phones usb port. No amount of wiggling in any direction would free it. Time to turn to Google for a solution. Not much help there other than someone suggesting sending the phone in for charging port replacement after suggesting the fast charger combined with a cheap cable may have allowed an arc to form in the port effectively \"welding\" the cable to the port. Panic set in as I resumed the wiggling process. I finally decided to pull harder and dislodge it, whatever the outcome. It came out finally. I plugged in my \"good\" cable and it showed \"charged\" so I knew it was working. I quickly disposed of the cheap usb cable so it could cause to more harm. Crisis averted. I can tell that the signal reception is much better than I had with my old phone. My old phone had good early morning reception where I work but it was shut down at 9:30 A.M. for the rest of the day. I was happy to see that was no longer the case with this phone. I had useable signal even inside the building. That in itself is huge to me. This a is a large phone. I work construction and wear carpenter jeans (with the pocket on the right leg) and all my previous phones slid right in that pocket with a slim case. This phone will barely fit naked. With the case I bought for it, it won't even begin to fit. Luckily the Unicorn Beetle Pro case has the belt clip so I can still carry it while at work... although I'm not a fan of the belt clip method. The case is very protective but makes the phone even huge(er). I have a slim case on order. The phone itself is fast, responsive and beautiful with more bells and whistles than any phone I've owned to date. It's going to take some time to start learning the tips and tricks that make this phone stand out from the crowd, otherwise it's a waste of this phones \"talent\". I'm hoping my luck and the longevity of the phone will keep this as my daily driver for years to come as Samsung has promised four generations of One UI and Android OS upgrades. (tl:dr) It's a big glorious phone sent safely at a good price. IMO... if you can swing the price, don't hesitate.",

    "review-text": "I just received my S22 Ultra yesterday, and I’m really impressed. It arrived in good condition with only very minor signs of normal wear and tear—nothing too noticeable at all. I was a little nervous as I read some of the reviews... Originally, I wanted more than 128GB of storage since I take a lot of pictures, but I upgraded from the S22 Plus (also 128GB) which felt okay to me BUT honestly, the space is still enough for the average person. I use a lot of photo editing apps and take plenty of pictures, and so far I haven’t run into any storage issues. The phone works beautifully, especially with the S Pen—it’s perfect for quick drawings or notes on the go. The camera is definitely a highlight. I’m loving the night mode feature, which really brightens up photos taken in low light. Plus, the photo settings are super customizable, and you can even create your own filters from images. Overall, for just $300 on Amazon, I was surprised by how premium it feels and the fact that its unlocked. NOT GSM BUT UNLOCKED. Even though it's a 2022 model, coming from the S22 Plus, this upgrade makes it feel like I’m carrying a fancy camera around. Totally worth it. Treat yourself.",
