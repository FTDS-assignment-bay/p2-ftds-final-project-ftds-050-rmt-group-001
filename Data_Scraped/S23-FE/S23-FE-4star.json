    "review-text": "The Samsung Galaxy S23 itself is fantastic. The screen arrived in pristine condition, the battery life is excellent, and the speakers are loud and clear without distortion. For the price, this is a steal. The camera quality is out of this world. Pictures stay crisp even at +3x zoom. It really is a great phone and I haven't found a better price for it. One important note: the phone is locked to AT&T. Unlocking it for use with another carrier can be time-consuming and may cost extra. If you already use AT&T, this phone is an amazing deal. If you plan to switch carriers, be prepared for additional steps and costs. Honestly I would say not even worth it if you're going to switch carriers. If you plan to keep it with AT&T then I think this is one of the best deals. Overall, despite the carrier lock, the phone performs exceptionally well and I highly recommend it.",

    "review-text": "My 2nd Samsung cellphone and the first time I've purchased a refurbished phone of any type. Arrived reasonably promptly and as it is an unlocked phone all I had to do was switch the Sim card and add my Wi-Fi password to get good reception. The phone to all appearances is brand new. This is a midrange Samsung device and is priced reasonably for what it is. Be a bit careful during setup to prevent getting your data take by the various online companies. My only concern is battery life, however that will become clearer over the next months and with a 90 day return policy I will have the time test it out. You can get a one-year warranty by taking a photo of what I'm posting. MY only COMPLAINTS thus far is the failure to provide a website with CLEAR setup instructions that lets you know the pros and cons of the various options. ALSO the phone is difficult to turn off which is the biggest negative thus far.",

Gave 4 stars because their \"excellent shape\" category for refurbished/renewed must be different than others.
