    "review-text": "Even though the phone looked great and was advertised as unlocked, I could never get it to work.  It would not read the SIM or ESIM provided by either company that I tried, and it took weeks and weeks and paying for phone plans through two different phone carriers for a month each paid up front to realize that the phone itself had some kind of flaw.  Both companies spent hours with me on the phone, trying repeatedly to get the phone I bought to talk to their system, as it was showing as compatible, but the phone itself kept saying to insert a SIM card, even though I tried three different physical SIM cards, , plus downloaded ESims from each company, and it just kept saying insert a SiM card.  Hundreds of dollars down the drain, plus an extra hundred in useless phone plans, and no way of finding out that it is actually a bad phone until it is too late to make a complaint, because it takes so long to get a SIM card from a phone company each time.  One of the techs said that it may be a cloned phone or from another country, or locked to a carrier, but sold as unlocked, but that they really had no idea what was wrong with it, just that they could find no way to get it to connect and talk to their system. The IMEI number loaded into it said that it was compatible each time, when they typed the number into their system, but when they tried to connect with an ESIM to get around the fact that the phone won't read a SIMP card, they got a message back saying that the phone was locked to a different carrier. Super disappointing purchase.",

The phone over heats, the screen touch gets stuck, low volume, wifi connection is awful and it constantly says my message doesn't go through but it does.

I waited over 90 days, MY FAULT, to try and set it up so I spoke with Spectrum and Samsung directly since I GOT ZERO response from this vendor but turns out it is now an expensive paperweight.. ALL I WANT IS FOR THE SELLER TO UNLOCK MY NUMBER, i DON'T WANT A REFUND OR REPLACEMENT. I spoke to Cannon USA as well and they said they couldn't help me that I had to reach out to Amazon. I got ZERO help from Amazon as well.. VERY FRUSTRATING but I admit, I am partially to blame..",

    "review-text": "Update: They have my returned item, but they keep delaying my refund. They got it almost a month ago and it said I'd get the refund by the 20th of May, then it got delayed to 1st of June, now its estimated to give me the refund in the middle of June. If the seller reaches out to me or processes the refund faster, I will update my review based on customer service, because I understand mistakes can happen. I am still paying for this one even though it is not in my possession anymore, so I would really appreciate a refund. The refurbished phone had the wrong screen installed, resulting in certain functions not working such as the biometrics (fingerprint) scanner not working, and resolution and color did not seem right.",
