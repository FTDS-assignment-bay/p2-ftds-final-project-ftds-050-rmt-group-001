    "review-text": "I ordered a renewed Samsung S23FE from this company for my wife and noticed when un-boxing that the charging adapter was dented, and also that this was not a Samsung charger.  I was able to charge the phone after un-boxing so thought nothing of it. The next day I moved the SIM Card, contacts, calendar, pictures, etc.  Afterwards, I thought  I should re-charge the phone.  This time when charging, the phone would cycle off and on as if I had unplugged and re-plugged the charger back into a wall outlet.  Also, I noticed that when I touched the charger it was extremely hot as well.  \"Very HOT.\" I grabbed my charger from my personal Samsung phone and the issue went away.  I then put the charger just received with the S23 on my phone and the same thing happed… cycling on and off and extremely hot! I called Amazon and after explaining all the troubleshooting I had completed agreed the charger needed replaced.  They said I would receive an email from “the Seller” as to next step. I received the below…. SELLER REPLIED: Sorry to hear that you’re having issue with charging. Here are some quick-fix you can try: 1. Turn off your phone and check the charging port for any dirt or debris (use a flash light if needed) 2. Use a slim toothpick or sim ejector, gently pick and remove any dirt you saw. 3. You may also try a different outlet / adapter / charging cable to find out if the problem is coming from the accessories. 4. Update the phone may help fix any glitches with the software preventing fast-charging. I then called Amazon back and they contacted the seller who said they couldn’t replace the Adapter itself but that I would have to return the newly received S23 with the defective adapter and they would then send another S23 with a new adapter.  This doesn’t seem a viable solution as I’d spent a large amount of time and effort moving the SIM Card, contacts, calendar, pictures, downloading apps, reestablishing user name and passwords, etc. I resolved to just purchase another charging adapter, but the Amazon associate took it a step farther and resolved the issue thru Amazon and not the seller.  What GREAT support Amazon gives!  What poor support options “the Seller\" gives.",
