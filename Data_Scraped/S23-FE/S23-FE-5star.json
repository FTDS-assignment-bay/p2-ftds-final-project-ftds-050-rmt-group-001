    "review-text": "This Samsung Galaxy S23 FE is my first Samsung phone after switching from Apple. I figured I'd get it refurbished in case I didn't like it. I really love this phone! It came in great condition, no visible damages. I transfered all of my data and photos from my iPhone to the S23 FE using a lightning to USB-C cable, which only took about an hour. The phone runs smoothly and has excellent battery life. It lasts me all day unless I'm doomscrolling. I got a Galaxy Watch that connected to this S23 FE using the Wearables app. People were saying that the phone gets hot, but it doesn't really. The only time it's felt hot is when I've had multiple apps running at once or had my brightness up. My only issue with it is that I couldn't sign into any Samsung apps or services for a few days. I even ordered a new one to replace this one, but the issue on this phone ended up resolving itself before I even got the replacement. I'd definitely recommend this phone. It came at a good price and is a super easy transition from a lifelong Apple user.",
