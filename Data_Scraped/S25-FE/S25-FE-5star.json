    "review-text": "This is a very nice phone at a reasonable price.  Usually, the \"FE\" designation just means the body of the phone is plastic rather than metal.  This phone works just as well as the S25 and will serve most users quite well. The 128 GB storage will hold thousands of pictures, etc. and all pictures and data can be transferred to one's computer if the memory should fill-up.  If you go to the two SIM card upgrade you will pay much more for the phone for not that much more \"bang for the buck\". Remember, this phone will work just fine for the MAJORITY of people who just want great calling, texting and photo abilities. The camera does a very nice job and is quite versatile.  You can do most everything you need for picture taking. One \"little\" problem however, you better know what you are doing if you plan to link/connect via bluetooth to your car hands-free system.  Connection takes \"patience\".  However, stick with it for once you do get connected the connection is very solid, clear and fast. If it would be helpful, my car is a 2024 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited with the UConnect-5 System in it.  It took a little bit of \"wrestling\" to get the connection made but it will eventually got through. The phone feels very good in the hand and it does have metal banding/edges all around it.  Definitely get a screen protector and some form of body case for added safety.  The phone works just fine with a screen protector on it because you can increase touch sensitivity through the phone settings. Take your time setting this phone up.  It has a \"thousand\" menus and selections that make the phone very personalized for each person.  Before doing the set up I would suggest you go online and look at many of the tutorials that are offered on set up and use. The phone is completely unlocked for ANY United States Carrier.  All you may need is a new SIM card to be sure you get the company services you want. These SIM cards can be obtained at the various carrier's stores--they cost about $10.00 and the technicians will install them for you.  These phones WILL allow you to use the new eSIM card set-ups also. I would recommend purchase of this Samsung S25FE phone for certain!  It is a great buy and should give you many years of service.",

    "review-text": "Been buying cell phones since the beginning all the way back to when they were called car phones, lol (shows my age) Once they went to texting and smart phones I have always bought budget model phones Samsung, Moto, etc.. I never really used them for more than texting and phone calls. Then came 2FA and apps for everything. I have always liked Samsung phones, I was ready for a new device and this time I decided to look at the top tier devices during the sales. NEVER APPLE or ONE PLUS so would be Pixel 10 Pro or S25 Ultra. Bought both... Usually I spent $150 -$200 and they get the job done so I was sceptical on spending $1K on a phone. The Pixel was ok, though not worth it over what I already had. Then the Samsung S25 Ultra arrived (with a free bundled set or Pro 3 Ear Buds) and all I can say is Wow! This thing is built like a tank, super quality construction. Love the material, screen OLED is amazing, camera is outstanding and the audio synced with the Pro 3 Buds is unreal. Put Spotify on and I hear thing in songs I have never heard before, the clarity and frequency response is like nothing I have ever heard before. I love Samsung because you can customize almost everything about this phone, they don't load it with bloat, and they make it easy to disable features if you don't want them, unlike some other brands. I run mine pretty lean without a lot of background stuff going and the battery charge lasts longer than any other phone I have had. I did not expect that at all. And it charges fast. Has every function I could possibly need and more is I want it. The feel is pure quality, has the durable OLED glass for protection. This thing has exceeded my expectations in every way and if you can get one, it is well worth it. IMO",

    "review-text": "Phone is a beast that hasn't flinched at anything I threw at it. Cameras have been great. Software is best in class, s pen is handy for quick notes. I do have some feedback for samsung though, some of these are nitpicks but I do wanna bring those up. - Camera is great for my usage but it would be great if the array of cameras was in a horizontal visor akin to the pixel -OIS on the space zoom camera. Sometimes I use my phone like binoculars when hiking and wanna snap a quick pic. Also maybe copy some ideas from apple like the camera button, the magnetic sensor shift stabilization, and square sensor. - More ram would be appreciated, 12gb is no slouch and I have no doubts it won't be a painpoint but competitors like google have it albeit with a much weaker chip. It's not that the phone isn't future proof, it's more that there could be more to be done. That being said the RAM shortage is surely gonna keep 12gb the standard for the foreseeable. future. -PLEASE KEEP THE SPEN. I don't care for bluetooth functionality but other people do. I just like it for quick notes and using it like a mouse. Honestly I wouldn't consider this phone if it didn't have it. -Silicon carbon battery? Now the battery has been able to last me a full day with the light performance profile, 1080p resolution, mostly on wifi, 6-9 hours of SoT depending what I'm doing. I do understand the US has some regulations on battery capacity and samsung might still have ptsd from the note 7, but companies like oneplus have it. Yes they do age faster then conventional batteries but even so, an aged silicon carbon battery can still have better battery than a conventional lithium ion. -I don't really play games on my phone, mostly use my steamdeck for that but I'm just gonna throw this out there... a sprititual successor to the xperia play would make me so happy. -Samsung I love oneui but please stop making duplicate apps for everything. It's a minor annoyance since you can uninstall/hide everything but come on don't be annoying. -speech to type is better on the pixel from what I've read online -maybe support the aptx adaptive and aptx hd bluetooth codecs -Bring gemini to android auto. Now I'm not a big ai user I turn off most everything except gemini and circle to search, I think it's obnoxiously implemented but google assistant is just plain stupid when using android auto. Also while on the topic of gemini, I want to be able to tell gemini \"play *song* by *artist* and it not be limited to youtube music and spotify. I wanna use other services like deezer or my locally downloaded music. -front facing speakers. I appreciate the stereospeakers but how cool would it be if we had both speakers front facing? -finally please implement a \"hold for me\" and call tree like pixels do. I know it sounds like I'm just envying pixel software feature but that would seriously be game over. Phone trees seems to be brain numbing nowadays and hold music is a form of torture.",

    "review-text": "With there being really no options now for a few phone or low price upgrade on any carrier this was a great deal.  Not only cheaper than if I got thru my carrier locally, but it's unlocked so I can switch off I want to.  IT ALSO CAME WITH A PROMO OF DBL STORAGE FOR FREE AND A 100 AMAZON GC!!! Why I like this phone.  LITERALLY took 5 minds to set up and transfer all my contacts and apps and set up on with my carrier. It is much lighter than my old Samsung 36. IT IS spec wise so close to the samsung s25. It is so fast with built in AI features which are fun and helpful. Overall if you are an android user this phone feels and acts like the phones that are 1200$ on up. I also like the changes.  It has great sound, great\"cleaner\" on the phone,  gorilla glass screen, and the fingerprint unlock feature is no longer the power button but on the screen. I learned long ago, even if you are super excited to start using the phone, be sure you charge it to 100% on the first charge.  Then go to settings, battery , and set it to never over charge.  OLD PHONE defaulted to cap at 85%, this one let's you set the top up to 95%. I used to have an electric vehicle and the batteries need to learn what 100 is but never overcharge.  This will extend the life of the phone and prevent major headaches in the future.  I keep mine on the charger overnight and playing my favorite sleep podcast- it stops at 95% and does not get hot. I am always playing audible books or podcasts and using Google maps.  The battery stays charged and by the end of the day it's around 70%. I am thankful samsung put out a good \"lower priced model\" than the s25 ultra. I also ran into using 99% of my storage on my old phone(128gb) I have every kind of app on here and it's only using 28% of my total storage so I highly recommend getting the 512 GB of you need lots of room. I am one of those people that keeps a phone forever and I think this one will last me a very long time.",

    "review-text": "The S25 Ultra is a very nice upgrade, especially from my old S9 Plus, better cameras, connectivity and a much faster operating system. I thought I would miss the option of having a micro SD slot however the 256GB is actually plenty, I'm storing over several thousand images and 4K videos and still only 1/3 full. The phone dimensions are similar to most flagship models on the market but the S25 is noticeably heavy and still tough to carry in your pants pocket, can be difficult to remove depending on what your wearing and if your sitting. The phone feels stronger however I use a case to protect it, makes is easier to hold and protects it from drops. I don't use screen protectors and so far after several months of daily carrying in pockets, taking to the beach and covered in sand, and carrying around the yard while working, I still haven't noticed any scratches on the screen or camera lenses. The new AI features are helpful and can be fun, Samsung has their own AI apps and so far the drawing assist is my favorite, some of the apps work best with a pen and the one included with the phone is actually very good. I didn't think I'd ever use it and was planning to hold on buying a new phone until the next model arrives, if they offered an Ultra without a pen, but I'm glad I got this one. It's also great if your hands are dirty and you don't want to touch the screen, it doesn't have any remote options for taking pictures but still works very well for most tasks. The cameras are amazing, vibrant images and taking pictures at night actually works. It does a good job of not overexposing lights in the background and clearly capturing the subject in front. The AI clears up a lot of the ghosting effect you get when the subject moves and the phone is set to a long exposure time. I'm glad I'm finally able to capture family moments when there's insufficient lighting, missed a lot of good opportunities with the last phone. So far the phone has been perfect and I'm glad I finally upgraded.",

The size is a bit bigger than the others but I love that I can actually enlarge the screen and be able to read the tiny print that seems to be appearing more and more. The screen is easy to maneuver and it's crisp and clear. Camera has serious capabilities so take a look at some YouTube videos on how to use and what to use for seriously great photos and videos. Always use a screen protector as you never know what will scratch it putting it in your purse. Lastly, grab that larger storage amount as this phone does not take a SD card. Nobody likes to delete things due to storage limits. I'm extremely happy with this purchase!",

Wonderfully made. Slick and nice. Not too big and not too small.  The back feels really good without the case. The phone feels light in my hand. But I use cases for my devices so that nice touch feeling goes away once i have on the phone case.  I took the Jet Black colour as I find it the nicest and best colour. The phone is lighter than my old phone. A Wonderful 7.9 \" display. I use my phone for Light gaming like Subway Surf, Lords Mobile, so the Exynos 2400 Should be good enough for me.  I also took the 256 GB storage because I like taking pictures and saving  Videos on my phone. The camera ... I must say \"WOW\" coming from the A71. It is too good to be true. It picks up a lot of details. The video is another  \"WOW\". One thing I have noticed is that the phone started heating up during the set up. So  I you are looking to do lots with this phone maybe go for the S25 or higher. I just got this phone because my old phone has numerous lines on the screen and I wanted something with bigger storage and better camera and at least 4 years of updates. This S25 FE gives 7 years worth of updates so good enough for me since my phones last me a  minimum 4 years. At the back of the phone in the images you may not see the silver rings around camera because I put on a screen protector thing for the camera but i might take it off because I love seeing the silver rings. So far its a great phone depite the heating up during the set up",

    "review-text": "Upgraded from an older Motorola, and wow, what a leap. I’ve been using this phone for about two months now, and it just feels like a power tool in my pocket—in the best way possible. Let’s start with the obvious: the screen. It’s absolutely stunning. The flat display is a GAME-CHANGER. No more accidental touches, and applying screen protectors is finally a stress-free experience. The brightness is insane; I can read everything perfectly clear under direct sunlight. Watching videos and scrolling is just buttery smooth. The camera system is next-level, especially for zoom. The 5x optical zoom lens is the real deal. I took a photo of the moon (yes, I became that person) and the details were incredible. But it’s not just a party trick. I used the 10x zoom at my kid's soccer game and could actually see faces clearly from the bleachers. The 200MP main sensor captures crazy detail if you have good light, and the low-light photos are far cleaner than on my old phone. The AI editing tools are also surprisingly useful for quickly removing photobombers or shadows. Performance is flawless. Everything is instant, apps launch fast, switching between them is seamless, and gaming is super smooth. The battery life is a marathon runner. I’m a heavy user (emails, social media, YouTube, some gaming), and I easily get through a full day with 20-30% to spare. The S-Pen is as handy as ever for quick notes and edits. I was worried about the titanium build and boxy design being uncomfortable, but it feels premium and solid in the hand. The matte finish doesn’t pick up fingerprints, which is a huge win. Is it perfect? It’s a big, heavy phone—no getting around that. And it’s expensive. You’re paying for the absolute top of the line. But if you want the maximum possible from a smartphone right now, this is it. Pros: Gorgeous flat display, unbeatable zoom camera, all-day+ battery life, blazing fast performance, useful S-Pen, premium titanium build. Cons:Large and heavy (not for everyone), very high price tag. Verdict:9.5/10. It’s the ultimate do-everything smartphone. If you’re a power user, a creative, or just want the best camera system on the market, this phone is worth every penny. No regrets at all.",

    "review-text": "I've been buying cheap, entry level phones for 15+ years and finally decided to try out the best of the best.  And wow.  This phone is incredible.  It's extremely fast at everything.  Image processing, gaming, applications.  All run without issue or slowdown.  The design of the body is sleek, sexy very durable.  I love the way the metal feels in my hand.  The overall weight of the phone is very manageable and I wouldn't consider it heavy at all.  The screen is top tier.  120hz is liquid smooth for gaming and apps.  HDR looks incredible on this display and it gets very bright!  I put a good quality screen protector on my display to keep it flawless.  Very well worth investing in a good one. The phone unlocks super quick via fingerprint which is a nice change compared to my old phone that felt like it took ages to unlock with fingerprint.  The S25 Ultra is basically tap the area and you're unlocked.  So fast! Overall, I consider this phone to be a great value for the money for anyone who is constantly on their phone.",

    "review-text": "⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Flagship Brains, FE Price — Incredible 2025 Value Samsung S25 FE Review: The Smartest “Affordable” Doesn’t Feel Affordable I upgraded to the Samsung Galaxy S25 FE 256GB (Unlocked, 2025) and it instantly proved that FE no longer means “the budget cousin.” It delivers a flagship-style experience powered by actual intelligence. The display is bright, sharp, and smooth, making everything from doom-scrolling to spreadsheets look unfairly good. The 256GB storage is perfect for heavy app users and photo hoarders like me — plenty of space, zero cloud-panicked storage math. Performance-wise, this phone is a multitasking ninja. I run work apps, streaming, navigation, and background downloads, and it handles everything without drama, lag, or turning into a pocket heater. The AI features genuinely help too — smart photo enhancement, writing suggestions, and adaptive system tweaks that make everyday use feel faster and more intuitive. The unlocked flexibility is a huge bonus — carrier switching, travel SIMs, or no SIM at all, it just works. Battery life? Solid. It gets me through the day with space to spare, even with heavier 5G and app usage. ✅ Pros: ✔ Fast and smooth performance for daily tasks ✔ AI features are actually useful (not salesperson poetry) ✔ 256GB storage = generous and practical ✔ Slim, modern FE design looks premium ✔ Handles 5G and accessories reliably ✔ Unlocked freedom is clutch ✔ No bloat-feeling slowdown so far ⚠ Cons / Tips: • Not the absolute top-tier S line — but honestly, unless you stare at spec sheets for sport, you’ll never feel like you compromised. • Pair with a good USB-C GaN Charger if you want maximum fast-charging efficiency. • Because it’s FE-light and sleek, consider a grippy magnetic case if you like snap-on accessories. Bottom line: If you want a phone that delivers flagship thinking, amazing everyday performance, and smart storage value — without flagship pricing guilt, this is your 2025 sweet spot. The S25 FE earns 5 stars not because it’s “affordable”… but because it never makes you think about the word affordable at all. 😎📱⚡💡👏",
