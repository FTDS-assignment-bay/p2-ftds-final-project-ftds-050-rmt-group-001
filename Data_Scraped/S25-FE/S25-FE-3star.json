    "review-text": "I wanted to replace an iPhone Xr with an Android device.  My thought process was something like, \"the Xr is REALLY old, and the S25 is one of the latest Android phones and will probably be superior in most if not all categories.\" Jebus cribst I was SO wrong.  First, the facial recognition - works about 20% of the time (and that's being generous).  Second, the fingerprint scanner - works about 20% of the time on the first try (and that's being generous). With my iPhone, I never needed the fingerprint because the facial recognition worked EVERY TIME with no issues. I paid for two years of Samsung Care+ when I got the phone, expecting to love it.  If I had not purchased the Samsung Care+, I would have already traded in this phone for an iPhone. Bottom line, if you are considering switching from an old iPhone, DON'T.",

    "review-text": "The build quality is very good, at least on a visible side of things. The phone is quite heavy. The battery life despite promises is not very impressive. With normal use it lasts approximately 36 hours, but if camera is used, particularly with high resolution, the battery will drain very fast since the phone heats up very badly. The screen quality is very good, especially no glare feature. I would definitely give it five stars if not a major problem. After a day of use the left part of the screen stopped responding to two finger pinching gesture for zomming in and out. It is happening with any application allowing zooming, such as Gallery, browsers, Photos, to name but a few. After a reboot it would work for a few hours, and will start again. I initiated a return with Amazon, and since Amazon wouldn't deliver a replacement on time for the return to be sent back, I purchased another one from Best Buy. And... absolutely same issue. Now both will go back because this is an absolutely unacceptable problem. Another problem that is annoying, but not critical. The sound volume jumps up and down when switching between apps. For example you are on a speaker in WhatsApp, you pick a regular phone call and switch back, the volume may jump to its maximum, or you increase the volume for phone conversation, it will also increase the ring tone volume. I have to say that I was spoiled with my older Galaxy S10 Lite, which served flowlessly for 6 years before the battery started failing.",

This is what happens when you try to copy Apple. 🤨 Additionally I was obligated to purchase a charger, because Samsung no longer includes a new one when you spend close to $1k for a new phone! To add insult to injury, the charger is only MARGINALLY faster than the one included with my Samsung Galaxy S10e!! Shame on all the companies obsessed with maximizing their profits at customer expense!!!",

I shouldn't have to go to a computer to update my freaking phone. This is ridiculous. Why don't they have the phones updated before they sell them to people?
