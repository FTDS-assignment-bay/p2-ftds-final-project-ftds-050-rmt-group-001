I do not need my phone to try to set a bathroom schedule for me, I can do that all on my own.  Don't need Bixby, AI, Cloud, or Google messaging.  Don't want the phone to try out think me. For God's Sake people Keep It Simple!!!!!  There are a lot of us older people out here that want basic equipment and a lot of us do not like Apple.  Anyway I probably will return the phone and see if I can get the S9 back on the air.",

    "review-text": "I am a professional artist: painter/illustrator/photographer. I use Adobe products like Photoshop. I was hoping to have a high quality camera on me at all times for photographing unplanned scenes and subjects (i.o.w. when I'm not lugging around my heavy Canon dslr and lenses). The jpegs this phone produces look fine in my Adobe products, (appear consistent with Samsung's Gallery app) and are acceptable quality for medium-sized prints, let's say 11x14. But for $1000+ I want the raw photos Samsung claims this phone can take. Once the photos get imported into Adobe apps, whether a mobile or desktop, it becomes apparent that the raw images are not really raw - they act like jpegs with a raw file ending. (I learned from researching, other users have found some third party apps can output the real raw images but those apps don't have access to all the camera hardware features. I did not feel this was an acceptable solution for such an expensive phone). Additionally the raw images appear terrible compared to their jpeg counterparts; they're extremely overexposed with odd color artifacts and pixelization, unusable as shot. This isn't acceptable for an artist with an existing workflow.",

    "review-text": "Not worth the high price.  Battery life and faster charging  was my main reasons for wanting a new phone,  but it wasn't actually better than my older A15 Samsung! Also,  I don't like some of the features or functionality compared to my older Samsung but everything else that I use was exactly the same.  I ended up returning it because I couldn't justify paying that price for so little benefit.  It just didn't seem like an upgrade.  Luckily I hadn't traded in my older phone and I ended up adding an sd card to ease the storage burden on it.  I'll just keep my old one until they stop updating or it fully stops functioning and by that time this new version or similar will be a much better price.  A good reminder that new isn't always better and definitely over inflated in price. It's often more practical to wait.  I have better things to do with my money.",
