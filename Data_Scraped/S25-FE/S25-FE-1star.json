    "review-text": "After 1 month of ownership, I am extremely disappointed with this phone's durability and build quality. On day 1, the day before the Otterbox case I ordered from Amazon arrived, I was walking my dog, she saw a rabbit and bolted. This caused me to accidently drop the phone from hip height (less than 36\") on to the sidewalk. It landed on its back, and a small u-shaped crack developed on the back glass. I did not realize the back was constructed of such flimsy glass.  This experience is contrary to the drop tests I reviewed before buying the phone, and I expected higher durability from Samsung. I'd have gladly accepted a more durable plastic back like some of the A series phones have.  Needless to say, it went in the Otterbox as soon as it came a day later.  I decided to live with the crack, as it was barely visible when in the case. About 3 weeks after purchase (July 2), I look at the back of my phone and see that the crack has now grown diagonally across the back of the back of the phone (see attached photo). Probably due to thermal contraction and expansion due to Maryland summers and the fact that my life does not allow me to stay in a constant temperature and humidity controlled environment. I decided to file a complaint with Samsung.  I got referred to a repair shop, who contacted me promptly to tell me that the repair would be out of pocket (roughly $130) unless I had Samsung care or something through my phone carrier. I am on the fence about doing this, but leaning towards doing it, especially if I decide not to keep this phone. Yesterday, I used the phone to take photos at the local 4th of July parade. Ambient temperature was about 84 degrees F. After about an hour of intermittent camera use, the phone became too hot to operate and handle. This is simply unacceptable! I have also found that the battery life claims are highly optimistic and not indicative of real world use. I am fortunate if I can get a full waking day (16 hours) from 100% to 15% (connect charger), and less if I am using the phone more extensively. I was forced to upgrade to this phone from my S20 FE since Samsung ceased to support the S20 series in May 2025. I am seriously considering either going back to that phone or replacing this one with either an A series or even an iPhone. Buyer beware! Your user experience with this phone may vary. I have been a loyal Samsung customer since the Galaxy S3, but that may change since my experience with this phone has been a bitter disappointment.",

    "review-text": "This new \"MINT\" green phone has been nothing but a nightmare since I opened the box. I ordered MINT green. The picture shows \"MINT\" green. The box they shipped it in says MINT green. The settings on the phone says \"MINT\" green. So instead of a nice, cheerful, spring green phone I would enjoy looking at, why did they send me a COAL ASH AIR POLLUTION GREY PHONE that is so smoky and dark I have to try to hide it in a case?! This is blatant false advertising. The product they sell you looks nothing like the false mockup picture they made up for the listing. I have asked everyone I know and no one thinks it's a MINT PHONE. It's GREY. Not only that, the whole experience has been downhill from there as I've lost a lot of the features and freedom I took for granted on my S10. I'm afraid to even use the flashlight because it gets so hot it burns. When I first turned it on I got a warning alert that it can cause skin burns. Can you imagine if the other brand tried to sell a phone with a flashlight that burns through plastic and causes skin burns so much they have to put a warning alert when it's toggled on? Games that played effortlessly on my Samsung Galaxy S10 overheat this S25, freeze, don't respond, or just don't run at all. I have a huge list of issues with this phone and I will never buy another Samsung product again. This phone has been a downgrade in every way and I really wish I hadn't gotten this horrible falsely advertised product. They shouldn't be allowed to make up fake product images and send you something so depressingly not what they advertised at all!",

    "review-text": "WOW just upgraded my Samsung S9+ to the new Samsung S25Ultra. Couldn't wait to start using it as I've heard such great things about it. Started moving files thru the Smart Switch app and it moved all of my files from one phone to the other using the cable method. Only to about 6 hours to move all of them. After the move, I was moving my music around to different playlists and went to play music and noticed that some of it wasn't playing. I thought maybe the file transfer was corrupted somehow so I deleted the music file off the phone. This time I downloaded just the music file thru the Smart Switch App again and this time and it only took 3 hours.  Went to play music and just as before half of the music wouldn't play. Went online to ask what the problem was or was I doing something wrong. I found out SAMSUNG NO LONGER SUPPORTS WMA FILES, THIS SUCKS!!!  I have an extensive CD collection that I like to move songs onto my phone so that I can listen to them while I'm away from home.  It's unfortunate the Samsung folks spent so much time and effort on upgrades to their phone that they eliminated the one function I use the most. Contacted the Samsung forum about the issue and Samsung's response for a solution to THEIR problem was to look for a third party app that may be able to solve it, however no suggestions given.  I have been a proponent of Samsung for many years ditching my Apple phone long ago because Samsung was so much better (except their Icemakers).  I'm now considering sending the phone back to Amazon and go back to using my S9+ at least it still works the way it was intended to.",

    "review-text": "Unfortunately there is no place to put a negative star. This is a very weak device. Terrible functionality. When I purchased this product I was moving to another town and I was very busy, therefore I did not have time to use it. So I missed the deadline to return it back to Amazon.  Be aware that Samsung only accepts returns upto 14 days. This device randomly freezes, to the point that you click on one app either does not open it at all, or you click on gmail suddenly it opens your instagram. Or you click on google map suddenly opens WhatsApp. It is a terrible experience since I paid above 1000 to make sure to buy a phone that I do not have this experience, but the phone feels like a useless toy in hand. I also called samsung customer service and they refuse to take it back even when their device does not work and it is only 40 days passed from purchase. I rarely write reviews, but this time I am writing to make people aware, you pay above 1000 but feels as cheap as 100 phone. Do not do that to yourself. What a shame, that a company knows how awful their product is that they do not want to get it back even after 40 days. I do not have enough money and time to follow up this issue legally, so be aware this phone does not work properly.",

They would not even look at the phone they accused me of installing the \"VIRUS \" to say the least I was disappointed with xfinity. I decided to go back to my s20 and return s25 back .

    "review-text": "DO NOT BUY YOUR PHONE FROM AMAZON!!! When there's a problem, Samsung points at the Carrier and/or Amazon to solve the problem. My selfie camera went out a little over a month after I bought it. I'm a computer geek, so I followed all of Samsung's detailed instructions in order to verify that it was a legit failure and not an App conflict. It took me hours to back up everything & perform the nuclear option and perform a Factory Reset. Nothing worked, so Samsung told me to bring it to a Samsung Service Center. I did, they confirmed that it was a camera module failure & I hadn't damaged it (the rear-facing cameras work fine). However, since the camera is so new, there are no selfie camera modules available, so they told me to contact Samsung again. Samsung said I could send them the phone and they would fix it and return it to me. Sure, about how long would that take, about 2 weeks? Seriously, go without a phone for 2 weeks!?! It's no wonder they are happy to provide a 1yr warranty, you can't really exercise it! Online with Samsung now... We'll see if they can resolve it. I've invested 4 days already, this was a big mistake! Don't make the same mistake I did.",

    "review-text": "I bought this phone intending to use it as my primary device running Android apps. If it were possible to install LineageOS or some alternate firmware then I might be using it for that purpose. However, it seems that's not possible. Some reasons why I want to install alternate firmware include: 1) I do not like the Samsung UI 2) I want to log in as root, change OS settings, run SQL statements on sqlite databases for apps, etc. 3) have the option to make changes to Android, compile those changes and flash those changes to my device. Since as I previously stated that is not possible, I am now using this device as a home router by enabling the wireless \"hotspot\" feature. Here are the things I like: 1) Good hardware. The upload and download speeds are significantly faster compared to iPhone 15 Pro Max. Things I do not like: 1) The lowest battery charge setting is 80%. Since this is plugged in all the time, I'd like to set this to 50%. 2) This is connecting my EightSleep mattress to the internet (the mattress doesn't work unless connected to the internet). One issue I have is that the Samsung S25+ will automatically install updates and reboot. And when it reboots, my EightSleep mattress is then disconnected from the internet and I cannot control it and I loose all sleep data for that day. 3) And finally, this is what I dislike the most: when there are no devices connected to the hotspot, it will automatically turn off. I've already had to go to the device, unlock it, and manually re-enable the hotspot three times today.",

    "review-text": "I work in Tech Procurement and Support; I bought this phone for work purposes or to handle daily life. I wanted something small and light, and for that, it 100% is. I'm a woman and have small hands, so I want this to be a good size. The battery is good, and I have no problems with connectivity. What we come down to a large problem is AI: Samsung's Vision and Language Core occupies a good portion of your resources. Encrouch upon them in space, and you likely will have a miserable time. It is a lie that you have \"128 GB\" on your phone. At least a 1/3rd of that and any resources on your phone is occupied by Samsung's AI. It will reinstall itself, no matter what setting you enable or disable \"not allowed to change system settings\" \"do not update galaxy apps\" it *will* reinstall itself at YOUR data and WiFi's expense. So embrace it, and enjoy it, or if you don't like it, buy another phone. Me personally, I will be selling this for scrap and moving on. Even my old Chinese OnePlus 12 had less bloatware than this crap. The AI Core I disabled on that phone? Still disabled, didn't re-install itself, didn't update itself.",

    "review-text": "Phone was working fine for a couple of months and had no less than 85% by lunchtime today. Suddenly the phone won't turn on or show it's charging. After calling Samsung and Amazon, i was advised to take it to UBreakiFix and there is no battery reading on their machine. He said it could be the battery or the port. Amazon isn't showing an option to replace, only return. I cant sent my phone back with all my pictures on it. Help!",

    "review-text": "Do Not Buy!!!!! Where do I start. I purchased this phone February when it just came out. 3 months ago I started having issues with the volume. It would go up and down by itself. It also would mute itself and I would be missing parts of a conversation  when talking. I have a one year warranty on the phone. I called Amazon because this is where I purchased it from. Well Lord and behold  Samsung tells me they do not replace phones outside of 15 days. They stated I would need to call Amazon because that is where I bought it from. Well Amazon has stated they will not replace the phone because it is outside of the 30 days. Well Amazon will end up being in another law suite because that is not what is stated on their page. Please do not Buy any expensive phones from Amazon or Samsung. This is not over. Anyone that wants to join in a class action law suite please reach out. This is unacceptable. Amazon needs to do better with these sellers.",
