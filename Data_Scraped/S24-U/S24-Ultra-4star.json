Fingerprint sensor is smooth and fast AF 4. Battery life is great and doesn't have a problem. Cons: 1. The phone's top heats a lot on heavy usage. Seems like a Samsung problem lot of threads in their forums. 2. The original charger cable wasn't included, the one included was a useless cable and 7W adapter. Make sure you buy original for perfect charging. 3.",
