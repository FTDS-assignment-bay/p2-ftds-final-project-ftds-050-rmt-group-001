    "review-text": "I ordered this phone back in February & back when I opened it, it felt brand new. The battery still lasts super long & charges quickly with my fast charger from Anker. It had a couple of scuffs on the back, but it's barely noticeable. Especially with a case, which I always keep it in. It does feel comfortable to hold without a case, but I prefer having a case for popsockets. The phone functions perfectly, I was surprised for a refurbished one. The speakers sound how they should (my cousin got the same model but brand new so I was able to test) even with a privacy screen protector on, the finger print reader works as well as the face ID. I definitely can see myself having this phone for years. I play genshin impact & honkai star rail on it and they both run superrr smooth. I also used to play infinity nikki on it and that ran pretty well too. But these games do drain the battery quite a bit (obviously). It really does feel like a pc in phone form. I have successfully connected my phone to monitors, but i havent done much with that feature. (Samsung dex or something like that) (I took these pics with my iPad so forgive the quality, the phone looks more deep purple irl. But the phone arrived with these scuffs. And here's proof of the battery charging fast & how long it lasts!)",

    "review-text": "Had the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL but returned it mostly because of the screen clarity was not as clear and vibrant as my older Z Fold 3 which despite being 4 years old was much more legible. The S24 Ultra screen clarity is outstanding and the adaptive display brightness level along with the anti reflective coating whipped the direct sunlight over the Pixel every day of the week. With the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL other than a few notification features that I'm currently tweaking with on the S24 it beats the Google Pixel. This unit from the seller has only extreme minute flaws that warrant the price I paid and I am very responsible with items and concerned about condition and maintenance. The battery on this phone with heavy use has been lasting over a day and I have almost 275 apps on the phone with the maximum dpi setting. I can't assure you that you get an outstanding phone but can vouch for my item. Spen works as it should. Good item that is like new.",

    "review-text": "I was initially hesitant to purchase a refurbished phone, but it has worked out far better than expected. After 2–3 months of use, I’ve had no issues at all. I’ve since placed it in a case, and it has been performing great. The screen is definitely scratch-resistant, which I appreciate. Battery life has also been solid. I don’t live on my phone since I mainly use it for work, but it still holds a charge well throughout the day. The only unexpected part was the color—it arrived more muted than I anticipated. Thankfully, the case I’m using adds more vibrance, so I actually feel excited to pick it up now. The stylus and notes experience is the best I’ve had on any device. My only wish is that the pen felt a bit sturdier. Aside from that, no complaints. The phone arrived fully unlocked and ready to use. Overall, I’m very satisfied with this purchase.",
