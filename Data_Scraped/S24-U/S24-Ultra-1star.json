    "review-text": "I bought a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra (Unlocked, Refurbished Excellent, 256GB, 12GB RAM, Violet) through Amazon Renewed, and unfortunately, my experience has been very disappointing. The phone’s model number is SM-S928U, which means it was originally carrier-locked, not a true factory-unlocked model (those are SM-S928U1). Because of this—or possibly another issue—the phone is stuck on Android 14 with One UI 6 and shows “up to date,” so it can’t be updated to the latest Android 15 / One UI 8. Cosmetically, it’s also not “Excellent” as described. There are noticeable scratches on the back, and the screen has faint white lines or faded marks beneath the surface that can’t be wiped away. It looks more like “Good” condition at best. Overall, this product does not meet the quality standards I expected from Amazon Renewed. It’s disappointing that something listed as “Excellent” arrived with both software and cosmetic issues. I’ll be returning it for a refund. Buyers, please double-check listings and model numbers before purchasing — quality control seems to have slipped lately.",
