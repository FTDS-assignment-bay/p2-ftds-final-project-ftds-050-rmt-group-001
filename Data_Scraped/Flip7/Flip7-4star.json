    "review-text": "Great phone, missing one ESSENTIAL feature. Samsung has done much to improve the Z flip since I bought the z flip 4 three years ago and this is a great budget option. However when I plugged it into my car to use android auto, it does not work, this is a deal breaker for me, I didnt really care about losing \"Samsung DEX\" Capability but android auto is a whole nother story. The idea that a phone from Samsung in 2025 is without android auto capabilities is frankly insane and my nissan leaf has the worst UI imaginable so android auto is a must. I will be ordering the z flip 7, and returning this phone once I've transfered everything over AGAIN. So if you are thinking of this phone and you need android auto. BUY A DIFFERENT PHONE.",

    "review-text_2": "Got this as a present for my wife and she absolutely loves it. It was super easy to set up and transfer all her stuff from iPhone over. My biggest worry was getting her apps and stuff reinstalled but I literally just plugged the phone into her iPhone and everything set up automatically. Despite the hype, my one “hesitation” with the folding phone is the screen. Only had it for 2 months and I already had to replace the screen because it was damaged somehow - still don’t know what caused it. If you want the folding phone then a protection plan is absolutely necessary or you’ll be paying to replace your screen out of pocket. Everything else has been awesome though - her battery lasts all day (sometimes 2), super intuitive to use and the switch from Apple to Samsung was very easy for her, and it is super fun to have a phone that flips open like that. Definitely made me want to switch to Samsung myself.",
