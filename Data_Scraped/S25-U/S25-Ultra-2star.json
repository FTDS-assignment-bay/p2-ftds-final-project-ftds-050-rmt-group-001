    "review-text": "The phone arrived on time and in good condition, but it was locked to another carrier, so my SIM would not work. This was not clearly disclosed in the listing. I had to pay an additional $200 USD to get the phone unlocked, which significantly increased the cost. The phone works now, but this was an unacceptable and avoidable issue. Buyers should confirm the device is fully unlocked before purchasing.",
