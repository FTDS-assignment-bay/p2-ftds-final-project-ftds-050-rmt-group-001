    "review-text": "At first, it appeared to work on Mint Mobile (T-Mobile network), so I assumed everything was fine. I performed multiple factory resets, updated the phone fully, and used it normally. After a Samsung security/modem update, the phone suddenly lost service. When I tried to re-add my eSIM, the phone explicitly warned that the device is locked and activation failed. This is not a glitch — this is a carrier lock being enforced after updates. Yes, compatibility checkers may say this phone “works” on T-Mobile or Mint, but that is not the same thing as being unlocked. This phone was clearly still carrier-locked, and that only became obvious after normal use and required updates — something no buyer would reasonably expect. This is extremely frustrating and misleading, especially since the phone was sold specifically as unlocked. If you plan to use eSIM, an MVNO like Mint, or any carrier flexibility at all, do not trust this listing unless the seller can guarantee true factory unlock status. I am returning this device.",

    "review-text": "I purchased this Galaxy S25 Ultra because the listing clearly said it was “fully unlocked.” After receiving the phone, it would not activate an eSIM. I ran an IMEI check and confirmed the device was actually locked to T-Mobile, not unlocked as advertised. I contacted T-Mobile directly and they confirmed only the *original owner* could unlock it, meaning this phone was not eligible for unlocking through any carrier support or service. The model number I received (SM-S938U) is a carrier model, not the factory unlocked U1 version. Because of this, the phone could not be used with my carrier at all and has to be returned. This caused a lot of unnecessary frustration and wasted time. If you need a truly unlocked device, double-check the model number before buying.",
