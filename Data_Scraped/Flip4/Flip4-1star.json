    "review-text": "Up to today, the phone has never been dropped (on hard surfaces), looks brand new as if it came out of the box besides a very small blemish to the right of the camera lens. The color is beautiful and matches what is shown online. The phone was very responsive and quick for multiple tasks, it even worked well on Genshin Impact (the game) besides getting a little on the warm side. I paid $299.99 (plus $18.00 tax totaling $317.99) June 22 2024. The phones screen started peeling and shortly after turning into a black line 8-9 months of ownership. As of today, ~16 months of ownership the black line grew to cover ~1 inch varying in size across the middle of the screen. (The progression of the peeling over ~7-8 months) The black line and above no longer responds to touch, only can see display above the black line. Under the black line works as it should. The touch screen not working on the top was discovered as of yesterday. I'm not sure of how many total reports there have been of this model of phone but with my experiences I would consider a different phone and perhaps avoid all of the Galaxy Z Flip or Fold phones. If you do consider to buy a Flip or Fold phone and expect it to last quite a bit longer than the warranty, while still being reliable, I highly advise to do your research. Sharing the steps I've taken so far... I've contacted Amazon. Seems they cant do much as its after a year of when I'm reporting this. I left a voicemail to Chubbiestech, the seller, to see what they can do. I will give Samsung a try as well as this problem is from a design flaw, not wear and tear. I also taken multiple pictures and a video of the phone and the phone case purchased for the phone to show the condition of the phone (phone looks brand new besides the screen where it is peeling and some finger prints on the sides) I would post the video however it is too big in size. The pictures shown are the phone along with the phone case. The case is scratched up a bit on the bottom left corner, however this only caused a cosmetic flaw to the case purchased separately for the phone. The case did its job protecting the phone for normal use excluding drops as the phone has never been dropped on hard surfaces. I'm sure its been lightly tossed on the bed, dropped into a pocket, and placed into a purse with other items that most likely caused the cosmetic flaw on the case. The phone has only been open while in use, so only fingers and weather touched the screen. A screen protector has never been applied to the phone. This is the first time I've ever had trouble with a product design itself sold on the Amazon platform out of 86 items.",

    "review-text": "THIS SUMS UP THE ISSUE............I understand it is out of the 90-day warranty however it is under 120 days, and I should not have to pay $100.00 a month for a product that you sold defective. A $400 phone should last more than 100 days. Do you enjoy ripping people off? You are the reason Amazon gets a bad name. Selling defective products that don't last 100 days and then want to claim it's over the 90-day period. Yes, the 90-day period ONLY expired within a couple weeks. But hey if you can sleep at night ripping ppl off, that's on you and I will personally make sure your Amazon Account health suspense's your account. DONT SELL HARD WORKING PPL DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS THAT DONT LAST 100 DAYS!!!!!!!!!!!! HAVE MORALS IN YOUR BUSINESS. 10 DAYS PAST THE AMAZON WARRATY DATE!!!!! I WOULD BE ASHAMED TO KNOW MY BUSINESS SALES BAD PRODUCTS, AND YES, I AM A BUSINESS OWNER AND SOMETIMES YOU DO WHAT IS RIGHT BECAUSE YOU HAVE MORALS AND WANT A GOOD NAME AND NOT TURN PPL AWAY FROM SHOPPING ON AMAZON. I DID NOT ASK FOR A REFUND I ASKED FOR A SOLUTION, LIKE SEND A REPLACEMENT AND I WILL SEND THIS POS YOU SOLD ME BACK AND SINCE YOU FIX BROKEN PHONES YOU CAN FIX AND RESELL BUT INSTEAD YOU WANT TO MAKE AMAZON LOOK BAD AND NOT HAVE VAULES WHEN IT COMES TO YOUR CUSTOMERS. YOU DONT DERSERVE TO SELL ON AMAZONS PLATFORM",

This appears to be a repeated and intentional behavior, aimed at taking advantage of customers.

Initially, I only used a physical SIM card, so I didn't realize that the eSIM feature was disabled. When I reached out to the seller for assistance, their only response was, \"90 days have passed, there's nothing we can do.\" All I wanted was to get it working! Essentially, if you don't notice any issues within 90 days, you're out of luck. Additionally, they misrepresent the product as unlocked and claim features that don't actually exist. Im stuck with a locked device!! And absolutely NO assistance from the seller since 90 days has been passed. From my experience, when you get the device, make sure it has Esim enabled and that is unblocked.",

    "review-text": "You might as well send me your money. This phone is crap. However I really liked it in the beginning. I purchaced it 12/18/24. Less than 4 months later I noticed a black spot in the right center of the screen thinking it was a smudge but it turns out the screen had seperated. The next thing I new the seperation went completly through the center of the screen and the top portion completely stopped working. Of course the return time was a few days past due so I lost my money. Of course this being refurbed, no one cares. Just to replace the Digitizer (screen) costs only a few $'s less than the price of the phone then you will have to labor to tear the phone down to repair it and on top of that it probably wouldnt work anyways. I lost a ton of data because of this and now have to buy and set up a new phone. Please check out the other reviews before you purchace the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 4. You will save Time, Money and mostly aggravation. OHH. PS. Not only the money for all the accessories that were also purchaced.",

My warranty on this phone was only good through august 2025. I would never suggest buying this phone. I'm an adult , no kids , no grandchildren , and only I touch this phone. How could this break so fast???",
