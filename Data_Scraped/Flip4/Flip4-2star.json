    "review-text": "Phone came in great at first, was loving it to death it's really cool phone. Worked flawlessly. It was my first galaxy, and I plan on getting a normal galaxy after this. The hinge is shockingly fragile, and I don't know if this is because it is a design flaw of the phone itself or because it's a refurb. A very short fall on that while the phone is closed and it's pretty much done for. It completely dislocated on one side and it would not open up all the way, looked decently repairable until the screen started dying. It eventually pinched the flexible screen and killed pixels. As far as I know there's no cases that protect the hinge. I was lucky to be within the 90 day return window or else I'd be forking over a lot of money in order to repair it :( I got a lot of compliments on it and I'm really sad to say goodbye to such a dope phone. But maybe later models will be less prone to damage.",

    "review-text": "I bought different renewed products from Amazon but this time didn't end up very well. As soon as I turned it on it was showing green lines; which in a foldable phone is a really bad sign. Things got worst and worst as I set up the phone, to the point where the screen would go off and on as I was changing the folding position. At times the whole screen would get of a shade of green, which I never seen before to be honest. I could not even use it for few hours that these problems started to show up, so I just packed it back and returned it. Maybe it was a defective unit, maybe it was a coincidence but this is the second foldable from Samsung that ended up having problems, and I am not going to take the risk, as I already wasted 1K on a Z-Fold 4 last year. Maybe it is better to wait few more years for a foldable phone",

This one disappointment me because it had a piece of the where it folds lifting on the edge. If it already had that at the fold it would be only gotten worse so I sent it back order same phone different seller. Paid a little more for it. But it came perfect condition. I now have the phone just not this specific one. Great sound, battery life lasts me all day and I'm primarily using it at work 8 hrs straight music. Light weight. Durable dopped a few times works as normal. No cosmetic damage. Overall I wasn't happy with seller but the actual phone,  samsung galaxy z flip 4 is awesome and different.

    "review-text": "I've only had my flip z 4 phone for 2.5 months and it's already of NO USE to me!  I was told by the Samsung office that the warranty on the phone expired before I purchased it and if I needed it fixed I would have to pay out of pocket to get the screen repaired.  I attached a photo of the phone which has a bleed that is growing wider every day.  The bleed started at the crease of the fold and got bigger and bigger.  BTW, I did not drop it!  It did not get wet! I only opened and closed as I used it.  This was a bad purchase!",
