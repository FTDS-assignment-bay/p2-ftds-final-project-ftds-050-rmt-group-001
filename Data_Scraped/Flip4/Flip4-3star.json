Screen resolution is solid, but the folded part is a huge point of failure, ive had three of these and all three of them have randomly died right in the crease of the phone, rendering the top part completely unusable as a touch screen and a fat bar of dead pixels that gets worse as you continue to use the phone. that said, i grew up in the flip phone and nintendo DS era and the motions of opening and closing the phone are enough to keep me from switching away.",

After a couple times that I dropped it on the kitchen floor, The inside of the screen started to mess up. I would get Thick black lines underneath the screen and a solid laser pink shooting across the screen until eventually the last time that I dropped it. I currently have a thick black line running all the way across the Screen. And everything above the folding crease I am unable to access because the screen has lost its sensitivity to my touch.

This phone is awesome, but something with the built in antenna that receives the cellular connection is messed up. Sometimes I can call and sometimes I can not. Sometime my Sim card will show unknown or att or t-mobile. I used att, I've even tried an esim to rule out the Sim card.
