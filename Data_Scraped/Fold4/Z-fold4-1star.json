    "review-text": "I purchased this Galaxy Z Fold from thegadgetdeals. I was excited because this is a really cool phone. I got it and visually it was in good condition,  it even came with a s reen protector on the inside screen. But then I noticed that it wouldn't charge wireless. 9 then noticed that the screen protector was coming g loose. After that I noticed what looked like a hair on the screen screen, it wouldn't blow off so I figured it was under the screen protector. I lifted it up and the hair didn't move, it later got bigger. I requested a refund and got it. The seller said it was a damaged pixel then charged me a restocking fee for a phone the clearly needed repaired. Accused me of dropping it cause they said the camera lens protector that I put on was cracked. Therefore even more proof, in their eyes, that the phone wasn't returned in the condition it was shipped. I will never buy from them again. And will tell my family and friends not to either.",

    "review-text": "I purchased this phone and have been using it for 5 months. All of a sudden the front screen started flickering on and off randomly. This was NOT after a drop or any kind of physical misuse. Over the next three days the flickering became worse and then on the fourth day the main folding screen went black - completely dead. I attempted to factory reset to see if that fixed the issue - no go it would turn on for less than 30 seconds, then hiss static loudly and shut off. While I was trying to verify my warranty it stopped making notifications, then it also stopped making calls, then it stopped being able to take calls... This phone all of a sudden after 5 months of regular use suffered what can only be described as catastrophic hardware malfunction. Over the next 3 days I was contact with Samsung customer service, sending over my warranty documentation more than 5 times - I kid you not. The issue is that the amazon renewed warranty is 90 days and for some reason that overrides the fact that the phone has a year long warranty through Samsung. I sent my documentation five times to three different agents and even though it showed as in warranty on my end (from the original documentation i sent through the website) each agent somehow could not see that the documentation that I sent in. I spent over a week with Samsung customer service arguing the fact that they were incompetent and my warranty was valid. Now I am still in a fight as it is showing a repair estimation and still showing as out of warranty - whether through the amazon renewed warranty issue or whether they're sayin it's physical damage (I repeat the phone has not been dropped, the catastrophic issues started randomly) I will never buy another electronic from Samsung - Their customer service is the most appalling thing I have ever experienced - and I will be moving to a different device without repairing my current one if they insist its related to physical damage.",

And Amazon stores directly, I sent my previous phone in to, to have a discount rate on the new phone from \"recell\" but they are separate. So I would have no fall back phone they didn't care, I asked but there was no work around. Not to mention you can't talk to anybody directly, Everything has to be on email or through Amazon site. Where you have x amount of characters in which to type a message. The purchase description doesn't tell you all of these things! After all of this, I find out I'm only getting half or my $900/something Repayment. Because they say the phone was broken. It was not broken!  And it was not shipped broken, it was shipped in the same box my brand new phone was. It was packaged very well, and there was no cracks on the screen, they attempted to send me a screenshots but nothing would open. DON'T  BUY REFURBISHED PHONES from them \"RE-CELL\".

    "review-text": "I purchased a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4 from (EXPORTTEK INC/ReNew Pros)  located at 410 FREEPORT PKWY, SUITE 100, COPPELL, TX 75019, US. I paid $612.47. I wish I would've been able to inspect this product before purchasing. You never know what you are going to get online. I received the phone in a timely manner and the appearance of the phone was excellent condition. I charged the phone fully and began to set the phone up. It did not come with a pen and within minutes the battery started dropping. After an hour the phone needed to be charged again. The phone couldn't even hold a charge! I reset the phone, repackaged it in its original packaging, and shipped the phone back immediately. This company has received the phone already, and told me once they have inspected it that they will issue a refund. This has not been the case. I have not received a refund and they have not responded to my latest inquiry. Not only did they send me a defective phone but they are trying to keep my money as well. I will be filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau, reporting this to Amazon, and making a statement on social media concerning their business practices. I do not recommend purchasing anything from this seller! I pray they can act like professionals and return the money that I have spent, but so far there is no hope.",

    "review-text": "Previously bought Fold2 & Flip4 from Amazon Renew & they both came in excellent condition. The problem is that too much can go wrong with the hinge on folding phones. I learned my lesson on this Fold4. Excellent condition means no scratches on the screen, which it clearly has. I was willing to overlook, because the process to resolve it is long & tedious. But literally one week in the hinge failed & would not open flat. Also, all 3 folding phones I bought did not come with the screen protector Samsung strongly recommends for the inner screen. In this case I lost $39 because I had to buy one & then return the phone a week later. Be careful with the folders, especially the Fold4 which has a redesigned hinge. If you must have one, do your homework, & if you can hold out, buy new. That being said, the excellent condition brings with it 90 day return/refund so in that aspect it was a safe bet, but they can dock your refund for certain reasons. If you are watching reviews on phones keep in mind that everyone reviews phones when they first come out. What you're looking for is the \"after one year\", or \"problems with the...\" reviews. ;)",

    "review-text": "An older relative 'had' to have this phone, so it was ordered, arrived timely and looked and I am sure worked very well.  The problem was the relative, as this phone was beyond their ability to operate.  Return was a breeze, and within the 30-day window for same.  Initial cost of $679 phone + $61.20 tax = $740.20 total.  Refund was only $197.00 based upon a \"Restocking Fee Refund Deduction: $543.20.\"  The phone had been turned on and attempted to be used, only way to find out it would not work for them.  Before returning phone 'reset' to original setting per its menu.  I more than expected to be charged something for this, but this amount!  Should this fee be standard across the board, I have had a valuable monetarily/mental schooling.  SHOULD THIS BE THE NORM FOR THIS DEALER, ANYONE LOOKING AT THEIR 'FOR SALES,' DO NOT LOOK AT - STOP BY SITE, WALK VERY - VERY BRISKLY BEYOND THEM AND THEIRS!  I can find nowhere on original purchasing ticket/site anything related to this amount of a gouging should an item be returned.  This is technically 8% of phone cost being returned to me ($543.20 div by $679.00 = 8%).",

All of a sudden it started freezing up out of no where. After that the Wi-Fi connection stop working, like it wouldn’t turn on the Wi-Fi at all, the option was grayed out it’s hard to explain. After that my camera wouldn’t launch, it would say “ camera can’t open while using other apps” I never seen a phone do that. And the last thing, when the phone would freeze I would have to hard reset the phone. The phone would restart but never boot all the way back up it would just get stuck on the Samsung screen. Now my phone won’t turn on at all it’s just dead I guess. I honestly took care of my phone I always do, so I don’t know why this phone just gave out like that. I don’t know if it’s the phone type, or if it’s cause it’s refurbished but I wouldn’t recommend this phone to no one.",
