    "review-text": "I'm seriously loving this phone. I'd been eyeing a co-worker's phone for a few years, and when I belatedly realized my Note 9 (which I hardly ever used) was no longer supported, I went for this right away. I think my only disappointment is that the S-Pen doesn't work the same on a Z Fold as it does for the Note. I'm happy with the screen, the battery life, the storage, the reception (not the best where I live, but this phone makes the best of it), the way the apps run, and the feel of the phone--although I keep it in a case, because I drop everything. I've yet to take more than one photo in it, but that one was fine. I may be firmly in the Apple walled garden, with my iPhone, Apple Watch, Apple TV, iPad, and MacBook Air, but I hardly use my iPhone anymore; it's now kind of just there to make certain features work on its fruity Companions. Some of my relatives who saw my phone over the holidays liked it. They lost interest when I answered their questions about the price, but my point is they were intrigued by my phone! If I could, I'd take off half a star for the way Samsung nerfed the S-Pen, but that's not an option. I don't think the loss of that functionality is worth a whole star, so it gets five in my book.",

    "review-text": "I was honestly sceptical of purchasing, as I'd read so many negative reviews. I decided to wait three months before leaving a review. The phone came in mint condition, no scratches, dinges or loose parts. SIM tray was easy to pop out, battery life lasts over 24 hours of usage varying from podcast listening and scrolling through social media apps. The quality of this phone is great. I was scared after seeing how glitchy and prone to breaking the Fold 3 was. Thankfully I spent an extra $50 on this model. It fits in female and male trouser pockets perfectly. As advertised, it truly is an unlocked phone! I tried AirTalk wireless SIM and it worked flawlessly and H20 Wireless.",

I can be reading my bible on one screen.And checking my email on the other. I also can open a third screen and minimize one of them. So it's like a mini computer. It is kind of heavy so I'd love to use my bluetooth because I don't like to carry it around. The picture quality is o k I think it could be a little better, but maybe I should upgrade to the six lol.",

    "review-text": "I want to leave a review after a YEAR of use — everything works perfectly! The screen is great, even though it has fallen on the floor a couple of times. The battery lasts just like an iPhone, but I knew that from watching YouTube reviews, since it’s a powerful device. And now the battery just like a year ago, nothing has changed. But the battery doesn’t get worse with the release of a new model like it does with iPhones! So I’m thrilled with this phone. I was an iPhone user for 13 years, and I have no desire to go back! If you’re used to an iPhone PRO model, you won’t really notice any difference in weight — they’re similar in that regard. I was also afraid to order it from this seller, reading the reviews, because I live in another country and wouldn’t have been able to return it, but in the end, I don’t regret it for a second!",
