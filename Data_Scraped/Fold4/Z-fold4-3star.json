    "review-text": "I am and have always been reluctant to buy a \"used\" or \"refurbished\" item. you never know how it will come to you and what condition, even if its described as good. So I pulled the gun on the ZFold 4 because my ZFold 4's inner screen died out. This a common issue with any of the Folds or Flips.  And to replace the cable and/or Screens cost about $500 - $800... and from there, you wont know if the place did a good job or not as well .. Anyway, so I received the ZFold-4 when it was shown to be delivered. When i looked in the box, it was missing the power cube.. I kinda got upset about it, but after going back and looking at the description, it never mentioned it would have one... my fault there. So, I looked over the ZFold-4 and I actually tried looking hard for any scratches, marks or anything and could not find anything. This ZFold-4 was basically NEW... I was very impressed.. So,after setting up the ZFold-4 i found that since this was an unlocked phone  it did not have the T-Mobile applications ( which would be obvious) .. not a big deal though.. So i have been using this for a few weeks now and it is still running good. I have noticed though that the battery life is not as good though. I have to charge it everyday.. my other ZFold-4 it was about a day and a half before I NEEDED to charge it.. so not sure yet if the battery may be a issue or not... I will be testing a bit more.. and if the battery still shows signs of degradation I may have to send it back, or try for another one....",

Service works now and the device works as expected. Device had a lot of scratches on the bezel in front, one ding in the main screen that wasn't enough to destroy any pixels (but is probably close), and one noticeable scratch on the cover screen. I would NOT call the device \"excellent\" quality (which is what I purchased); more like \"good\" quality. However, I am going to keep the device.",

    "review-text": "I bought this phone because i was impressed with the large screen.  However, after using it for 3 weeks I found it functionally hard to use.  The phone has two modes, the first is the closed position the other is when you open the phone.  In the closed position, it is only about 2 in wide, this made it difficult for me (with fat fingers) to correctly enter information on the keys.  When the phone is open, its about 4-5 in wide which makes it very difficult to hold in one hand.  It was easier to use when open because the keys were much bigger and easier to press without inadvertently press an adjacent key..  The phone is a great phone but it just didn't work for me.",

Two handed, sure but it's a struggle, and it makes it much harder to just flip back and forth between screens When opened, the keyboard splits. Probably better in the long term, but i didn't care for it at all It's a brick. it's big, it's heavy. Maybe some don't mind, but i really didn't care for it at all The crease. this was expected and not completely terrible, but also not something that i think i would get used to. In the end i really didn't think this phone was worth paying almost double the price of a regular phone and even if it was the same price i probably would stick with my non foldable phone for now.",

I purchased the \"excellent\" condition option and the phone is nice. No scratches or visible dings or anything. My only complaint is that it's obvious that the inner screen was replaced, that's okay, not a problem but I don't think it was put together correctly because you CANNOT fully open this phone flat and theres also a little bit of some type of adhesive or glue that I had to clean from the gaps of the hinge mechanism. But honestly for the price I don't care. I just hope it doesn't crap out on me before the fold 6 comes out because I'll be trading in for that. Other wise I probably would have returned this phone for not being able to fully unfold.",
