    "review-text": "Where do I start on this journey? I ordered a Samsung fold 4 on January 9th, through this vendor on Amazon. The Phone was refurbished and several hundred dollars cheaper than anyone else, it also had the Amazon 90 day warranty so I figured, what the hey! The phone arrived a few days later and looked fine, after opening it and turning it on, I was prompted to enter my Wi-Fi password and then to log into Google for set up..... easy enough, but about 3 seconds later the phone went blank with a warning from Samsung. \"this phone has been temp locked by Samsung because it has been either reported stolen, lost in transit or not turned in on a phone upgrade. It gave a number to call Samsung so i did. The lady there said she couldn't help me and i needed to contact the buyer. I called them and asked what's up and they told me the phone wasn't on any black list and shouldn't be locked. They offered me a refund and sent an email with instructions to ship it back. Well a few days later they received the phone and issued a partial refund. The phone was locked with my google account and until I was able to unlock it, they wouldn't issue a full refund. I called them and was able to unlock the phone for them while talking and they said the full refund had been issued. When the first refund was issued I received an email almost right away saying i had received it. This time i got nothing. I waited a few days and still nothing. I called the company I used to purchase the phone through ( Affirm) and they said they had only received 1 refund. After several calls to the vendor and 5 or 6 calls to Amazon, we figured out the second refund was issued as a account credit or \"gift cert\" but that's not how it was purchased. So on the phone we go again, 5 more calls to Amazon trying to convince them the refund that I got just so happened to coincide at the exact second i received the gift card was the issue....Well, you'd think that would be easy to understand but nope!!! after a few more calls and being asked on each one to speak to someone higher up, i was told the issue was with the way it was refunded and Amazon had fixed it, I should get the refund in 48 hours...... 2 weeks later.... nothing, I finally gave in and said screw it, I'll just use the gift card. So.... in the end, the vendor sold me a locked phone, somehow between them and Amazon ( nobody will accept the blame) the refund was screwed up and i have a gift card now. Looking back I wish I would have just payed the extra money for a new, unlocked phone and skipped the middle person. Lesson learned I guess. The phone looked to be ok and if your willing to take a chance on going through with the giant mess I did, give it a shot. If you have bad luck and don't have time or money to spend on waiting and making phone calls.... I would give them and Amazon a hard pass. I know things can happen and do, but to ship out a phone that Samsung easily told me was on a black list seems strange..... I don't know maybe it wasn't but it was a time wasting ordeal, I for one won't be doing it again. Best of luck!!!",

    "review-text": "I really, really wanted to like this phone. My friend warned me ahead of time that he had to switch back to a non-foldable, but I thought it was a matter of his uses and preferences. The front screen is both shorter and slimmer than most flagships, but I actually found it pleasant and easier to reach all the corners. Unfortunately, something about the phone's shape makes it so fragile that after putting it in my pocket with no other objects around it, the built-in protector started to crack after 5 minutes of me casually walking around the house. Even after putting on a case, there are now several large cracks in the protector despite no drops or impacts, just normal pocket wear, placing on counters, etc. The most disappointing part is the way it interacts with apps. The ecosystem just isn't compatible with foldables yet, so unless you want to be a pioneer with potentially years of hit-or-miss experiences, it's probably not worth it just yet. The compatible pen is also so large that it begs the question why they didn't make a normal sized S Pen and integrate it into the phone's body. You can only use the pen on the inside screen, so it takes away all of the quick versatility I enjoyed with the Notes. I used to use my pen for everything, and now I don't use it at all.",

It seemed to get worse everyday.Everytime I opened the screen I’d hear the sound of the screen cover lifting from the display and see a wide bubble forming (about 1/4 to 1/2 inch) running from the top to the bottom.  I checked reviews and comments on line and found my problem to be somewhat common. All Z Folds seems to be susceptible to this issue. From the reviews, I learned that Samsung has a mixed record of covering the cost of the repairs, with some users saying it costs $500 for a repair, even with a warranty.  I love to try the latest technology, but with it comes a risk of becoming a beta tester for the company. Samsung says the sceen has been tested for 400,000 cycles, but mine showed issues beginning at only 40 cycles. A huge disappointment.",

When you open it it is supposed to open flat. This one didn't open all the way and I didn't want to force it for fear of breaking it. It was like if you were reading a book in your hands. That's not how that phone is supposed to operate. I'm confused because it says that it was tested and operates as it should and it certainly doesn't. Not sure who is testing these phones but this is an obvious \"something aint right\". ALSO, I think it had a software issue because it kept asking me to download the update....I didn't this literally  6 times and it kept asking. Needless to say....I sent the phone back.
