    "review-text": "Love the phone! It's a Samsung too so I can't complain. Because of it's size, the phone is super lightweight. The battery life could've been a whole lot better. You will definitely need to carry some sort of power bank for this low mah phone. I couldn't believe how the screen had zero scratches on it. The phone definitely performs exceptionally well. Do not buy this phone if you have fat fingers like me. Texting and typing on this phone can be a huge headache for people with large thumbs. The only thing I have to complain about is the top of phone has 2 chips that are completely noticable. I guess whoever had it before dropped it without having a case. Still, this phone is a beast and I'm really happy I got it from Amazon even though they lied about the condition.",
