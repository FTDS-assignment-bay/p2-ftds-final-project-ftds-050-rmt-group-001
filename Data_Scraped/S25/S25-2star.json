    "review-text": "Not sure whether to return or not. Phone (Galaxy S-25) is in excellent shape, but has the Verizon logo flash on boot up, continually reminds me I don't have a Verizon esim, and it gets software updates from the Verizon network. I was able to load a Consumer Cellular esim, it does appear to work correctly for phone calls on their network, wifi and blue tooth are operable, but the Verizon bloatware is annoying. If you buy from this seller, just know that you may get the phone to work on your network but you will never be done with reminders about its Verizon origin.",

This device has a ton of glitches, the screen routinely flashes whiles streaming or watching a video, charging is painfully slow, and battery life is laughable. Not sure if those are the same issues with all S25 phones or just refurbished ones from this seller but I'm incredibly disappointed. A waste of over $400.",
