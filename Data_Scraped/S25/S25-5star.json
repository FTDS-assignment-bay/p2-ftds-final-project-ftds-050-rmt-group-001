    "review-text": "I almost didn’t buy this phone because of some reviews claiming it arrived locked. I’m extremely glad I went ahead with the purchase — this was one of the best Amazon Renewed experiences I’ve had. First, the phone itself is excellent quality. It looks brand new, not refurbished. No scratches, no signs of wear, strong battery life, and smooth performance right out of the box. Now, about the unlocking complaints — especially important to clarify: This phone was sent to Asia, and it was still very easily unlocked by simply following the clear directions included in the box. The paperwork inside explicitly states that you do not need to pay extra to unlock the phone and that if the device arrives locked, you should contact the company directly. I did exactly that. Their customer service was beyond helpful — quick response, simple instructions, and the phone was unlocked very fast with zero hassle. The process was straightforward and worked exactly as promised, even for international use. After going through this myself, it’s clear that many of the negative reviews come from people who: • Didn’t read the papers included in the box • Didn’t contact the seller • Or assumed the phone was permanently locked without following the provided steps If you follow the directions they give you, the process is quick, easy, and stress-free. This company clearly stands behind their product. The phone quality is outstanding, and their customer service is truly top-tier — especially impressive given that this was handled across regions. I highly recommend this seller. Excellent device, excellent support, and a smooth experience from start to finish. 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟",

And great size too - fits decently in my women's pants pockets, and not too big of a screen to work with (I used to have the iPhone 13 mini). Good cameras, speakers, battery life, flash light. I like the adaptive screen brightness, oled display - nice on my eyes at night. It's fun to play with all the customizable features it has - check out the Good Lock app, it has even more customization fun.",

Ditch the plastic SIM and download an eSIM using the Verizon app.  As always, YMMV.",
