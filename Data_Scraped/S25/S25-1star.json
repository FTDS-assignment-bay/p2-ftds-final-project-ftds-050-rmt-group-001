    "review-text": "phone had minor scratches and appeared to have an aftermarket screen replacement but worked fine and seemed unlocked....so i kept it. 4 months later after a routine android software update the phone locks down and reveals that it was still attached to the previous carrier and now i can no longer use it. Apparently this is a common scam where sellers don't properly unlock but instead use hacking software that works just long enough to avoid liability. i'm enraged",

    "review-text": "When I bought the phone it was unlocked. After a software update from the manufacturer, the phone has become unusable. After taking to both my carrier and Samsung twice it turns out it's now locked to a carrier (Verizon). I spoke with Verizon who stated that the previous owner broke their contract so they won't be unlocking the phone. I contacted the seller who tried to tell me that it is indeed unlocked, but the software update just reverted it back to the old carrier. They sent me instructions that required downloading two different applications on to a PC, then hooking my phone to it and what not. For one thing, I don't own a PC, for another thing, when buying an unlocked phone you shouldn't have to go back in to it to \"unlock\" it yourself. And, this just seems like a work around. I told the owner that I was told by Samsung, my carrier, and Verizon that this phone is locked to Verizon and he \"assured\" me this wasn't the case.  I think Verizon would know. Just be weary of buying an \"unlocked\" phone. It might be temporarily unlocked but a software update could have you left with a phone that's only good as a tiny tablet with no phone capabilities.",

This is my first time not going through a carrier to purchase a refurbished phone and I cant even use it. Now I see there are others who purchased this phone and they were still locked. Amazon should do a better job of holding its vendors accountable for false advertisement. This phone was still locked to Mint Mobile, and they refuse to help me aince I dont have an account with them. I use this phone number on Cricket, and they tried to fix it for me, but their hands are tied. Ridiculous how consumers are being taken advantage by corporations, and all the supposed  protections amount to nothing. This is nothing more than theft by corporations.",
