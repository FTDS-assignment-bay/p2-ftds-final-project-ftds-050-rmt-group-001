    "review-text": "While the device has the potential to save my marriage, it comes with strings attached. 1. Screen defects: there are structural lines at the top and bottom, suggesting it may not be an OEM. 2. Scratches and nicks indicate it was dropped on the face several times. While the rear glass is excellent, the camera rings are scuffed and dinged. The sides have minor scratches at the top and bottom. Battery performance seems excellent.  The non-OEM screen performed excellently in all tests. Camera, microphones, and unlocked status are all excellent.  So, while it's had some repairs and shows wear from previous use, it's like that old red truck you see around town that's outlasted two of your newer vehicles. Bought in excellent functional condition, but the appearance is good at best. Four stars!",
