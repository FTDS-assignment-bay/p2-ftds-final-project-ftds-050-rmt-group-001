    "review-text": "USA unlocked didn't work with my carrier. I had to return this phone so unfortunately do not get to enjoy the quality camera or other nice features. Try going for Universal unlocked if you can. As far as the device goes it was of quality and sturdy. It has what looks like a great camera.  It does lack the external port for wired earbuds and no microSD. I still think refurbished is a great option. Just make sure to test the phone as soon as you receive to make sure it will function with your carrier. Make sure you have the current sim card that does 5g to ease the transfer etc.  Even checking to make sure not blacklisted and finding it is ok does not mean it won't have the carrier compatibility issue. Now I understand the difference between the type of unlocked and I am sticking with factory unlocked(universal)",
