Battery is pretty good. Camera is impressive. We ordered a phone in excellent condition and it was. Just a little wear along one edge. No scratches at all. Highly recommend!",

The phone came in almost like new condition, with only minor cosmetic nicks that were not obvious unless looking for them. The screen was in excellent condition and came with a plastic screen protector already. The phone holds a charge well, everything works like new, and it came unlocked as described. The seller is also quick to respond to questions or concerns, as I was initially uncertain if the phone was unlocked and reached out to ask. Overall would recommend this seller, and would purchase from them again.",
