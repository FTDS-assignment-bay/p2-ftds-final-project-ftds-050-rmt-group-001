    "review-text": "This phone came with a few small scratches which I was not thrilled about but it was not a make or break for me. However, after using this phone for a month I noticed that the screen had more issues than just that. For one I had to clean the screen continously because it was more prone to smudges. Not to mention the screen had a really gritty and dry texture. I thought this would be easily fixed by using a screen protector. However, every screen protector I tried to put on it they would never completely attach correctly to the screen. It would either have bubbles that I couldn't get out or they would have these large dark spots. This is after trying three different brands of screen protectors. The biggest concern I had about the screen was when one morning I woke up to my screen having a lot of condensation. I have a very cold room due to having POTS so I have had all of my phones in my room for years and not one of them had this kind of problem. I also noticed that this phone had a lot of scratches on the case and even a big dent on the side. The phone I use to have was a Samsung Galaxy S10E. It was such a better phone than this one and half the price. I noticed that my S10E had a far superior camera than this phone as well. The pictures were very blurry and had terrible lighting, not to mention the video had terrible stability. I ended up sending this phone back. It just didn't feel worth the price. One of the good points of this phone was the set up and SD card insert. I had no problems with putting in my mint mobile card. I would not recommend this seller because it was not packed well and came with no charger or cord. I decided to buy a Samsung Galaxy S21 5G instead and couldn't be happier.",

    "review-text": "My s21 ran into some charging issues so I decided it was time to upgrade. Got the s23 here and have had the worst connectivity issues I've ever had with any phone I've ever owned. I have 2 other phones that I bought on Amazon the S10 still works perfectly, the s21 had the charging issues but it was perfect for almost 2 years before that and it's still useable I just have to position the cord just so. This phone was awful almost immediately. Today alone I had to restart this phone about a dozen times in 2 hours bc it would sporadically disconnect and none of my apps would work. Super frustrating. It took me half an hour to pair new ear buds and it only worked after I restarted. I've missed phone calls and video calls bc my phone was not connected and I didn't know. It never shows a disconnection, I only know bc my apps stop working. Got my refund started and going back to my S10 until I find a decent replacement. It is pretty tho and besides the connectivity issues the phone is great. Unfortunately, connectivity is a deal breaker.",
