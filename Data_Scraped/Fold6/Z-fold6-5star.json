    "review-text": "This is my first foldable, coming from the Note 20U an I'm very impressed. It is a renewed version but it looks brand new an works well. I will switch out to my Note for work an working on my car but going out I will use the Fold 6. I choose this over the 7 for spend support, coming from the Note I would really miss the pen. The screen seems good but the company shipped it in the closed position, I understand that they didn't have a box for it. The price was great an the build quality is good. It is a heavy phone but I like it.",
