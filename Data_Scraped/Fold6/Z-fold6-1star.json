I received my phone with a dead pixle spot on the screen and a line of dead pixels running down the crease. Sometimes half of the screen flickers. These refurbished phones are BS. Don't waste your money and move on. You may as well just spend the money on a brand new 0hone. I'm going to have to get the internal screen replaced and that's going to cost around $1000 for a genuine Samsung screen. $1789 in total for this phone.",
