    "review-text": "This is the clearest, scratchless, and wearless refurbished phone I ever gotten today! Not even a single blemish or anything printed on the screen. The moment I unboxed it, it was fresh out the box, which was an eco-friendly box, as you bought it from the Samsung store or Best Buy! Don't forget about the battery life and connectivity, as it is unlocked and it lasts a good 9 hours since it's opened, and it comes in a pretty good price deal too! Totally recommend this item the next time the same excellent refurbished S24 phone comes again from the same seller. Thank you for blessing my delivery with such cleanliness!",

    "review-text": "I mean, it's the most recommended phone on the planet it seems regarding android at least. I had it narrowed down between the oneplus 12/12r, pixel 8/8a and the galaxy s24. It's a hard pick, but when it came down to price, availability and software update schedule for refurbished, the galaxy s24 came through especially because I needed the 256GB version. The phone is as good as everyone reviews it to be. The camera is great, though this time it can actually auto focus unlike my s20 being sporadic. I really like the direction samsung is taking their software experience. Very useful apps and features, I don't feel like I'm missing out on anything important. Device care is one of my favorite tools. Maintenance mode is such an important feature. Diagnostics comes in clutch, I use it all the time to make sure my phone is in top shape and it does tell you when the battery life gets low as it did for me. When I got the phone, it got to work and automatically updated it's software to the latest versions all the way up to One UI 7 and android 15. Samsung plans to allow 7 years of updates I believe, which I'm all in favor for. I almost exclusively buy phones used or refurbished and even though 7+ years of updates may sound like a lot to some people or even excessive, it is perfect for people like I and many others who rely on used or refurbished phones. Last time I bought a refurbished phone, the s20 and I could only used it for 2 years before it will stop getting updates. Thank you samsung for  being a top contender in this area. I appreciate the fact they finally are keeping flat screens at least on some of their phone models. Curved screens became one of the most annoying things I've ever come across with a phone because it doesn't offer any improvements on function or easy of use and exposes my phone to more damage from drops and open sides. I want my phone case to fully protect my phone. Apple doesn't even do curved screens, get rid of them all samsung. I was hesistant to buy refurbished/renewed from amazon as you always hear mixed reviews for this kind of stuff, anywhere really. I did an exhaustive amount of research and finally got familiar with the pros, cons and what to actually look out for when buying refurbished so you have the best chance as getting what you actually want. Once you know what to look for, it's pretty simple, you just have to know which specific seller to buy from, but most importantly which to avoid. There are some red flag sellers out there and here on amazon, I suggest you do your due diligence and figure out who they all are. Macalegin or whatever their name is, is a great one though, just look at the seller's reviews and that should tell you most of what you need to know. I've been using samsung off and on since 2012 and they have improved so much over the years. Starting with the s20, I finally felt like I was able to experience the way android is supposed to be, smooth, fast, etc. Now with the s24, I feel as though I don't need to continue looking for a better android experience. It's already here.",
