    "review-text": "Be careful buying \"unlocked\" unless it's factory unlocked. While it may work on any network you will not receive updates for the phone if it was previously locked to another network because the software is locked to a network. My phone was telling me it was up to date even though it was on Android 14 rather than Android 16. I did a few hours of research on Reddit and learned the above information and how to fix it. It requires downloading Samsung firmware from Frija and a program called ODIN and reformatting the phones software. It's not hard but it is time consuming. If your not up for the challenge, skip this device. From my research it seems to only be the s24 models with this problem. The only reason I did not return the phone was it was in excellent condition and I paid $350 for it so it still seemed like steal even with 8hra of my life dedicated to fixing it.",
