    "review-text": "Phone arrived in great physical condition, but the listing was misleading. Although sold as “unlocked,” the phone was stuck on Android 14. Samsung already says this model should be running Android 16, yet the phone claimed it was “up to date” and would not update. After hours of research, I learned it is still controlled by the previous carrier, meaning it will never receive Android updates under normal use. Checking the serial number or IMEI does not warn you about this. Another review mentioned this exact issue and they were 100% right. Fixing this cost me hours of my own time, and shipping was also delayed. If you want a phone that actually updates, buy a true factory-unlocked (U1) model.",
