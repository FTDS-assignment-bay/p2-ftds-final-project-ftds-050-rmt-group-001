    "review-text": "I was a bit iffy about this product, and honestly, I still am as I'm typing this on my phone. But, it arrived in absolutely perfect condition. No scratches, and the packaging was just okay, but hey, it got here, and that's all that matters to me. It came with all necessary accessories. It had a screen protector that was too small for it.Everything worked, all the apps too. It did get pretty hot the first week, but then it cooled down. I had to update it a bunch; it wasn't updated at all. I also noticed something in the top and bottom speakers, but the audio is still amazing and totally blows my mind, especially coming from a mono loudspeaker. Overall, I totally recommend it. It still has 5 big updates left, so it's still current.",

    "review-text": "I really enjoy this phone, the battery life can go for 36 hours even with some pretty good use. However if you have your brightness on too high then it won't last as long. The phone is beautiful and sleek. It doesn't feel bulky or large in my pocket. I am able to add a phone wallet to the back and it still feels a good size. I promptly put it in a case, as I drop my phone all the time, and the screen hasn't cracked at all. Seems durable. The screen does not have a protector and I put this phone in my purse, pockets, dropped on the ground and it doesn't have any issues with scratches which I am very happy with. The camera is superb. Which, if I'm honest, is the biggest reason I bought a new phone. I am so happy with all the features this phone has.",

    "review-text": "Phone was packaged well and arrived with no noticeable scratches or dings.  Battery is in good shape and lasts about 2.5 days on a charge with light use.  OS reports that battery is in good health.  No issues connecting to my Ubiquiti WiFi 7 AP on 2.5/5/6 GHz; peak link speed is over 2.6 Gbps.  Decent 5G coverage in my area which uses hybrid LTE/5G-NR radios; no weird call dropping.  No Bluetooth issues so far.  Speakers and microphone are clear. Phone was SIM locked to T-Mobile, which T-Mobile unlocked upon request in person.  No problem reflashing firmware to the U1 edition with Odin, which removes a lot of the T-Mobile bloatware.  Works great with Mint Mobile. In comparison to my older Galaxy S10e: glad to see the rounded screen corners and Bixby button gone.  The screen auto-brightness and fingerprint reader work much better.  The S-View cover doesn't support touch, but it doesn't block the rear camera anymore, either.  The Gemini AI stuff is everywhere and is difficult to remove.  Samsung is more insistent on you creating and linking a Samsung account.  A number of home screen widgets have weird font issues.  Using a USB-C headphone dongle is annoying and I'm worried that the USB-C port will break over time.",

Some issues with biometrics, so I assume the screen was replaced and the sensor is slightly off. I use pattern unlock so it won't be an issue for me personally. Couldnt get it to connect with my mobile network on my own, but I took it to one of my networks store locations and the lady there called their tech department and the 2 of them were able to get it sorted out for me. 4 stars for the minor damage as the lady at the store said there's been a lot of bring your own phone issues recently on my network so I'm blaming the network related issues on that. Color matches the listing. Phone purchased for use in the US on T-mobile. This review is being posted within 48 hours of receiving. If I have further additions I will mark them as an edit at the end of this review.",
