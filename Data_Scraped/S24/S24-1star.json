Specifically: • GPS functionality fails approximately 90% of the time • Cellular reception is extremely poor or nonexistent, despite the fact that I live in a city where normal cellular coverage is strong and reliable • I cannot reliably make calls, use navigation, or access mobile data—even in areas where reception should not be an issue These are fundamental functions of a smartphone, and the failure of both GPS and cellular reception has made this device unusable for its intended purpose. This has caused ongoing inconvenience, wasted time, and significant frustration.",

I would stay away from this seller and read the most recent reviews before  making a purchase. Especially if you do not have another phone to switch back to.",

So once I tried to activate this S24 that was actually locked it canceled my physical Simm card. I was left with no working phone. I was forced to either buy another Simm card or buy a phone from my carrier.  I couldn't wait weeks to gamble if another \"unlocked\" phone was actually unlocked.  So this whole purchase was horrible and very inconvenient.  Don't fall for the same mistake.",

I received the phone and transferred my SIM card from old phone to the new phone and could not make or receive calls. I tried to switch the SIM card back to my old phone and could not use that phone anymore. I went to the Verizon store and was told my account was suspended because the device ID came back to a stolen phone or one that had a unpaid balance associated with it and it could not be activated. It was a real hassle to get my account unlocked. It was kind of a nightmare. I also had to pay $20.00 dollars to ship it back to them, for a phone they should have known had issues, and they may change me a restocking fee!",
