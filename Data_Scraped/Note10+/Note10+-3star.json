    "review-text": "It works almost as good as new but every night and sometimes throughout the day I get alerts of the stylus being ejected when I haven't removed or touched it. The stylus that came with the phone did have a bent, unresponsive tip. My old phones' stylus was fine so I switched them out. There are times where apps crash or freeze but I'll take that over the issues I had with my last phone, which prompted this replacement. It was easy to setup. The phone did come with all the needed parts including a charger and sim card removal tool. The phone was blemish free other than the broken stylus tip. I didn't have any issues getting my data and service transferred over.",

My phone keeps asking me to connect the S pen via Bluetooth and it wont connect  because it doesn't appear to be the Bluetooth version of the S pen, like i should have received.  I can use it on the phones screen but i have none of the other features i should be getting with on the Note 10 Plus, like camera control with the pen and air motion control w/ the pen.  I am disappointed that I paid a good amount of money for this phone and it didn't come with the proper parts.

    "review-text": "I am mostly enjoying my 'renewed' Note 10+ and I particularly love the amazing iridescent color. The phone is so lovely I don't want to use a case but for protection I use a thin clear case which is close to the sleek uncovered experience. I wish they'd stop with the curved screen on the Note line, it is frustrating to use the edges and tougher to protect. I appreciate it is running smoothly with Android 11 and I just upgraded to the Android 12 final beta. I do wish Samsung hadn't abandoned their VR Gear products because I enjoyed them and bought headsets and controllers which are now useless. I may still exchange or return the Note 10+ before the 90 day period because I've been annoyed by the speaker often causing the phone to vibrate in an unpleasant way even at medium volume. Also, since switching to it, a number of videos have refused to play correctly, instead showing jagged lines and I can't find anything online about the issue so I am suspecting a memory issue. Overall I love the Note series and I think the Note 10+ is a great phone, especially if I can get these few issues resolved.",
