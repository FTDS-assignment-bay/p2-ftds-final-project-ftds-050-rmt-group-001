    "review-text": "Great phone! I've always been on Verizon prepaid and it was so easy and simple putting my Sim card in and setting it up. It came with a sim tool and a charger. I bought one in excellent condition and it came as described just a few tiny scratches on the screen but you can't really tell at all and I'm very happy and pleased with this phone. It's so beautiful and so far haven't had an issue with it! If it does I will definitely come back on here and put it in my review but hopefully all continues to go well. It's pretty fast loading and so far no battery issues whatsoever. I bought a case for mine just because I don't want to chance anything but overall this phone is fantastic and I would definitely buy it again! It came 2 days earlier than expected and I would definitely recommend this seller to anyone! I had a note 8 for years and always wanted this note 10 plus and I can't tell you how happy I am with it!",

    "review-text": "I don't want to speak too soon... I've only had it for half a day. This phone IS renewed, meaning there's always a chance that a problem may pop up and just hasn't yet. If it does happen, I will update the review... HOWEVER... So far, no issues. The condition listed for mine was \"new\", and from what I can tell, it definitely was. I don't see any scratches or dents or anything. It makes me wonder what part of it was \"renewed\". It really does feel like a brand new phone, other than obviously not coming in the original packaging. It fast charges and wirelessly charges fine. The screen is bright and works as it should. The S Pen does its job flawlessly. If you are considering purchasing, I cannot speak for all the sellers, but this one was great. Shipped on time. Keep in mind that this IS renewed, so it will not come in the original box or with the original charger. Mine came with a Motorola power box, but hey, it does the job! When the Galaxy Note 10 Plus first came out, it was $1100. I got this basically brand new one for $300 in 2024. Zero complaints here. This flagship phone is an absolute legend and holds its own even though it's like 4-5 years old. It's got a better camera, more storage and RAM, and so many more other features that my lower-end modern 2024 phone had for the same price. Everyone is always obsessed with \"brand-new\", when really they should worry about the quality, overall value, and lifespan of their devices instead!",

    "review-text": "This was really the first 'big' purchase I have made so far, aside from my car. I have been using an absolutely rallied Galaxy 8+ since highschool.  And let me say, what an upgrade! I did a lot of review reading on both under this phone, and the sellers that partner with Amazon Renewed to sell it. My Galaxy 8 was renewed, the first one didn't charge, sent it back and got the one I kept, but headphone jack never worked. In a so far successful attempt to avoid something like that with this phone, I decided to order through Edge Cellular, since they had the most positive response. And I'm so happy I did! First of all, I got the phone in FOUR days, including the day I ordered it and the day it arrived. I live in Alaska, so that's practically unheard of.  The only way I could tell this phone was not brand new, was two extremely minor surface scratches on the back, which is obviously expected. And the S Pen had a tiny bit of white paint on it, that wiped right off. Other then that, the phone was pristine, not even a fingerprint, until I picked it up. It started right up, charges perfect, it's unlocked, the S Pen works, battery life is basically stagnant if it's not being used, and it's absolutely beautiful. I don't have any complaints so far, it has been almost two weeks since I received the phone. If that changes, I will update my review :)",

    "review-text": "Great value for the money you pay. What comes in the box?? Mine came in a sketchy looking white box but contained a fancy shaped sim injector, cheap cable (not Samsung), and a cheap charger block (also not Samsung). The phone did have plastic peels on the screen, camera setup, sensors, and around the edges of the phone. I tested every last one of the sensors in the phone.with the built in number you can dial in the phone app. S pen feels great but the latency of this generation is definitely not the perfect smoothe experience, though that is not to blame the manufacturer. BATTERY! the battery life is Amazing. Some days it will go all day on a single full charge, but on occasion it will rapidly die faster than expected. If your getting this to play games on it then I have really good news for you. This phone can and will plow through max graphics 60fps call of duty mobile, plays apex legends mobile smoothly, genshin impact also runs well. Screen wise The screen is nice and bright, very colour accurate compared to my galaxy a10e LED panel. The note 10+ has a 91% screen to body ratio. Meaning most of the phone is screen. The screen itself is an AMOLED/oled display, really dark colours and blacks are at their best here. Screen curves do not impose too much accidental touches. Screen didn't arrive with a single mark. The display automatically uses either 1080p or (3/4) 4k It comes with 256 gb of storage (I love) and 12 gb of ram (hardly ever uses 6) Price So for what after about 2 or 3 months of using this, I would say that the normal $799.99 hefty price tag one of these note 10+ cost in store let's renewed prices shine bright. For saving about $300 you will not regret purchasing this. Now it is on its last leg for security updates and further android updates, but android with one UI version 4.1 is all it needs. Finger print reader and facial recognition are nice.",

The screen is super touchy but once I put a case on it that took care of that issue. I'm not one that needs the latest version or a super expensive phone so this one was perfect for what I paid for it. It was unlocked and compatible with Cricket Wirelss so all I had to do was swap out the SIM card from my old phone and I was up and running. Lots of storage and I LOVE the stylus that comes with it...it does some really cool things! Would highly recommend to anyone who just wants a decent phone without an outrageous price tag.",

    "review-text": "I just got mine four days ago today and may I say I was SUPer skeptical but I have been impressed from day one. My phone connected to everythinh wit b out a problem. My phone chip installion wasnt a problem. Everything about this phone is pretty great. The phone itself is glass so I got a case immediately. I wanted to wait a few days before I did a review just so I could get a good feel and I am thoroughly impressed. The only thing is the finger scanner is not as good as some other phones but that's okay because of the abundance of other features so I really don't mind. I would definitely recommend so far! Later on down the line I will update this comment with how things are going. I will also share photos later as well.",

    "review-text": "I just received my phone in the mail today. I LOVE this phone. I have much newer Sansung model as well but I wanted a second phone and I bought this one because I love the camera on it so much. There is a super wide angle that my newest model doesn't have. The portrait mode also seems to be better for some reason. So basically this will be my second phone to record video as an influencer and an additional phone for taking those beautiful wide angle photos and portrait photos. It's also SO light. Totally recommend this phone!",

    "review-text": "1. Fast shipping A+ 2. Note10+ looks pristine A+ 3. Works on Verizon (unlocked). Just added Sim & works. A+ (came in AT&T box, was confused at 1st glance) 4. Battery in great condition. A+ Cons: the battery came completely drained & took a few minutes to respond after it was plugged in. I imagine this is why fast charging didn't work at first. To fix not fast changing, charge to 100% let the battery drain a bit 80%, with the phone unplugged from power, then flip the fast charging toggle a few times, finally leaving it on, in battery settings. Then press volume down & power at same time for 10 seconds to force shutdown. (you may have to change power button preferences from Bixby to Power button in settings. Mine was set to Bixby upon arival). Power on phone, plug in \"fast charge\" QC 3.0 capable cord & CHARGER to phone. Fast Charging fixed. Next step was to fix the wifi from intermittently turning off. In settings, go to \"connections\" then \"wifi\", click \"3 dots\" top right, select \"advanced\". Make sure 'Switch to mobile data\" is turned off. Go back to \"settings\" main menu, scroll down to & select \"General management\". Once inside select \"Reset\". Finally \"Reset Network Settings\". It'll explain that wifi, mobile data, & Bluetooth hardware will be reset to factory settings if u continue to \"RESET SETTINGS\", click it. Restart phone, reconnect ur wifi & fixed. (It was probably the 10 updates that screwed wifi hardware settings). But now all is perfect & running as should be & I don't fault the seller for the wifi issue. Although, the fast charge not working is most likely due to seller shipping drained battery. All in all, great purchase & value Note10+ 12GB ram 256GB storage.",
