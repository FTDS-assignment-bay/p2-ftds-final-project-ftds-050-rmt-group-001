    "review-text": "Seller: Snergy Order Date: March 19th, 2022 Order price @ Time of purchase: $419 **The phone arrived arrived a few days after it's scheduled delivery date. Though the status of it was updated alongside actual package arrivals/departures so that was fine. Unboxing: Opening the unoriginal boxing the phone came in; It arrived in a plastic bag within a white cardboard box. The phone shipped with unoriginal wall adapter/brick & cable. And none of the OEM accessories like the AGK headphones nor an actual SIM Card Removal Tool. It came with a paperclip instead. Outside Impressions: • The phone was impressive lighter than my Note 9, which this phone was replacing. I noticed the weight difference immediately. • I inspected the rear glass and was blown away by the this color: Aura Glow. The finish and how well it captured light and reflected objects in its glass was and is still great. • The camera system was without damage or scratches. • However the metal frame of the phone at the bottom had deep grooves of scratches from a hard drop it seemed. It can be felt with hand and enough depth to catch on smooth surfaces. Damages were along the sides as well. • The build felt solid in hand, when I didn't focus on the damages from the past user. Study but light. Took some time to get used to. • The Screen was huge. 1440x3040 that can be turn down if you are concerned about batteyr life. Bigger screen to body ratio than my Note 9 as well while not bigger much larger in its actual dimensions for me. I have fairly large hands. What troubled me mostly was the damaged screen. It had a noticeable gouge in the screen towards the top right 1/4 of the display that simply could not be ignored. It was easily felt under thumb and finger and even visible with screen off/on. **I returned the phone asking for a refund as it was beyond regular wear and tear use. Synergy gave me NO problem whatsoever with this. And emailed me within a few hours to a day that they will process a full refund upon receiving the product back. I did pay shipping back for the device. I was disappointed with that however I am happy with Synergy's customer support even though my product was not as it should have been. It gives me confidence to purchase with them in the future as good customer service is hard to come by today. The only issues where the damages that I saw and tested the phone As for today, 4/14/22: I have ordered a new Note 10+ 512GB version this review is based on the good working device I received and couldn't be happier with the device itself outside of the features it loses from the Note 9. The Note 9 was truly the last no compromise Smartphone of the Era. So i wouldn't call the Note 10+ an upgrade > Note9(N9) as much as I would say a Left-Right change of features for the user.. • Fingerprint scanner: In screen fingerprint sensor.. While consistent in my use, it is slow to read even with developer mode enabled. • Face Scanner: To make up for the \"poor\" speed of the FP scanner I make use of the face scanner feature to unlock the phone. This isn't the same as the Iris Scanner from the Note 9 (N9) and it is not as secure as the Iris Scanner but to serves my needs the same and is faster than the finger print scanner and faster than the Note 9 Iris scanner (both have .5 animation speed in developer settings). • The features of the S Pen are nice but I haven't explored them all. I do consistently use it for various tasks and apps and signing documents and editing. • Camera is very good. MANY settings in the pro mode and many camera modes itself. I use GCam myself. Big improvement I believe. • Still testing battery life as the phone learns user usage to better optimize battery will update • Phone calls are clear and good. • Speakers are impressively loud as well. I'm glad because I watch videos/play music (Netflix/Crunchyroll/Spotify) often. Bottom firing speaker and earpiece speaker sound good to the ear. Snapdragon chip, fast and 12gb of ram. No lag and running andriod 12, running 4.1UI but I have a launcher that I find suits my needs better. You won't be made at this phone in 2022. I only upgrade, at most, every three years unless phone is stolen/loss/damaged outside warranty. Definitely happy with the huge screen, faster chip, S Pen, SD card slot (fitted with a 1TB  PNY) and factory unlocked.",

I ordered an aura glow to match my previous note 10 but was delivered a silver. Oh well, those cost more anyways. It came with a screen protector which was ironically the first thing I did this time. Everything seems to be working seamlessly. Thank you!!!!! Also the pen that came with it is blue. I saw someone else complain in a review about that but oh well I hardly use it anyways, plus who doesn't like blue? 4 stars because I don't like silver lol. Now my phone matches my husband's but that's alright! One flesh and now one phone style 😂",

    "review-text": "Bought the phone from Chubbiestech back in July 2022. Phone arrived in near perfect condition besides some scuffs and scratches on the S-Pen. Also, the S-Pen didn’t work when i received the device. Not sure what it was but the phone wouldn’t recognize the S-Pen. Reached out to Amazon who then contacted the vendor and they send me out a replacement that worked perfectly. Everything was fine until a week ago, Wednesday night. Took the phone off the charger and used it that night and everything worked fine. Put the phone down to go to sleep, woke up the following morning and the phone wouldn’t turn on, wouldn’t charge or anything. Looked up Youtube videos and tried pressing the power button and volume up and down buttons for 15seconds but no dice. Reached out to Amazon and was able to return it and get a refund even though it was out of warranty but Amazon rep said i couldn’t get full refund but still got something back as it stopped working within the first year. Think i paid a bit over $300 including shipping and taxes and got refunded about $260. So, not bad but really intended to keep this phone. Overall pretty pleased with the phone, unfortunate that it blacked out on me within the first year but will be getting another Note 10 plus. Would highly recommend even in 2023.",

    "review-text": "This is the 2nd Note 10+ I purchased from this Seller. Both phones appear and work like NEW.  Although they are \"unlocked\" for use with most carriers this phone (my 2nd purchase) is an AT&T branded phone and is loaded with AT&T's typical \"bloatware\" which cannot be removed without \"rooting the phone\" which I do not intend to do. I bought this phone for my wife and she really doesn't care about the bloatware since she really only uses a dozen or so apps. The phone has ample internal memory, 256 gb, along with 12 gb of ram this phone is powerhouse compared to her old phone (a Galaxy Note 4). She is happy and when \"Momma's happy I'm happy\". Commenting on both of the Note10+ phones I've purchased from this seller I can honestly say there was NO HINT ANYWHERE that either phone was \"renewed\" except for the generic white box they came in. They looked BRAND NEW. I watched comparison reviews of the Note 10+ vs. the Note 20 + prior to purchasing these phones and the thumbs up went to the Note 10+.  and the cost was less than 1/2  of a new Note 20+  The only other minor issue is the fingerprint readers aren't very reliable. These phones were a good fit for what we needed and this seller did everything right. I WOULD recommend to my friends.",

    "review-text": "The phone came pretty much as good as new. The only thing that gave it away was that I could tell it had a phone cover on it by looking at the dirt/marking around the camera lens. If the phone was cleaned properly I wouldn't have been able to tell it apart from a brand new phone. If you are wondering if the Note 10+ is good for you or not here is what I've found so far. Productivity wise it's amazing, it makes doing a lot of \"phone things\" easier. If your number priority is a great camera this one will disappoint you. I don't know what Samsung did but the camera in my opinion is terrible. I wouldn't use it to post on Instagram(Maybe a story) But other than that it's really great, charges really fast especially if you get the original 25w charger. The charger that was included was terrible and made a weird buzzing noise, so definitely purchase the Samsung 25w charger. Summary: An amazon renewed phone comes like new, the Note10+ is amazing at being a phone but terrible with taking pictures and videos.",

The phone overall is a great phone but there are used qualities for example the volume buttons sticking, gashes, and cuts in the phone.

    "review-text": "The s pen keeps disconnecting. Guessing because it's a 3rd party replacement. Occasionally the bottom speaker will stop working and only the top one will work. The only way to get it to start back is if you playing music and you get a notification. Sometimes when the s pen disconnects the touch stops working. Little things here and there is the reason I'm returning it. But Customer service is great. Reply fast and are really helpful. That's why I gave it 4 stars and not 3. But if you can get past the little things the phone looked perfect. No blemishes. Camera worked and looked great. Literally looked brand new.",
