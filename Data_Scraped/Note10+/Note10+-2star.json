My phone company was able to to turn it on manually, then out of nowhere it stops working again, this time my company is not able to get my data to work. Text and calls work but thats about it unless I have wifi. Probably not a legitimate company refurbishing the phones. When I received my phone I also noticed it did not even feel the same in weight as my old one, so probably cheaper materials.",

So, I had to find other ways to transfer my data such as NFC, etc. But, when I was done after spending four hours of my time to get everything set up, the device did not work in my car for navigation; again, because the USB C did not work for data. It was a pain to try and set up, going back and forth researching for solutions on YouTube, etc. And then, it was working one moment and not the other. So, I gave up.

I constantly have to fight with the brightness level a few times a day. Any email, private message gets to me a few days late. This was not a problem with my previous 10, so I'm a bit annoyed.

The battery life wasn't the best and it did heat up but the main problem and reason why I won't be using Amazon renewed again is because who would've guessed, the phone is locked. At first, I didn't mind all too much and figured I could simply unlock it with the resources given, nope. I've called customer support 3 times, went to a store, basically just wasted a lot of time to finally be told it can't be unlocked.
