    "review-text": "This phone is great. I bought one came amazing. Still using it as I'm typing this. Bought another for my bf and it came with black dots on the screen. (Dead spots) they didn't make it easy to return and I don't have a car. Had to take ubers to even go to the return place. Then took about a month and a half to refund me the credits. So bf was with no phone for a whole month and a half because his broke hence why I ordered this to be here in 3 days lol then they tell me to get a refund I must return the broken phone first. Would be fine if I now wasn't 270 dollars down until a month and a half so to get a new phone for the mean time would've been crazy and a waste of money. Nobody will steal a broken phone. Even version gives you a lender when they mess up. That's insane they expect you to have no phone nor ur money back in a timely manner lmao. Rude customer service as well. Not a discount or even a thank you for previously buying a phone from them and giving a nice review.",

    "review-text": "This phone (Note 10+ 256GB) was purchased as a present. Since the seller was listed as Amazon Renewed Store,  I thought it would be a legitimately safe purchase, boy was I wrong. The phone itself came very nicely without any cosmetic damage with a new cord and generic charger. After installing SIM card from my phone carrier (Cricket), the phone show that it connected to the network. I was able to play around with it and use my data to download some apps. But then something odd happened, my mom complains to me later that day to say she was not able to call me and instead heard a recording that simply said \"this caller cannot be reached\". So I tried calling her, instead, it immediately goes straight to my carrier's customer service line. They ask what I need and I explain how I have new phone and I switched my SIM card to the Note 10+ and that I cannot make or receive calls, but I can use my data. She asks me to give the phone's IMEI number and looks it up. Before telling me what's up, she asks me in a curious tone how I obtained the phone in the first place, which I tell her I purchased it on Amazon. She then informs me that the phone itself is blacklisted from all networks because the phone was reported STOLEN and that it is impossible to make it usable. Darn, so much for that...",

    "review-text": "I just got this phone in the mail. Came with a charger that gets burning hot smells like burnt plastic, should've been a red flag but I still gave the phone a chance. I open the phone to multiple scratches, okay cool I know its used at least its not cracked. I go through the process of turning it on following the instuctions and it still tells me its a Verizon phone. Okay, maybe I have to go through manually and do the IMEI number, THE PHONES IMEI NUMBER IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH MY CARRIER!?!  But its suppose to be a FULLY UNLOCKED phone!?! The packaging was terrible to begin with. A rolled up paper ball on one side, then it looks like the charger was just thrown in the box along with the phone with a piece of bubble wrap that didnt cover the entire phone. This is the second time ive tried ordering a phone on amazon for it to not work correctly because it was never fully unlocked. Returning it tomorrow morning as it was packaged. I took a video of myself unboxing everything and putting back in the box to avoid them refusing a refund. If you areba verizon user buy this phone its perfect for your carrier but dont do it for another carrier. That is all.",
