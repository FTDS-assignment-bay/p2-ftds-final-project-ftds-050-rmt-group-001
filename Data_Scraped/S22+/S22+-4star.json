    "review-text": "I'll come back to this review every once in a while as I continue to use the phone. EDIT2: 7/9/2023 Okay the line is not going away after locking and waking the phone like it did before. You can see in the second picture, it's faint, but it's there (ignore the orange glow, that's from my old s7 that can't take pictures of other screens without struggling). The fact that it wouldn't go away makes me think it's getting worse. I had to restart it this time to make it disappear. Went ahead and started the refund process because it seems like it's getting worse. Unfortunate because this was labeled as an excellent condition phone too. I guess it's hit or miss what you get when you buy refurbished. I'm not a phone repairman, so I'm not going to be able to open it up and figure it out. I'm just gonna refund this and get a different phone to avoid the problem happening again. EDIT: Okay, it's been 4 days since the review. Woke this morning and unlocked my phone, typical. Was adjusting notification volume settings then all of a sudden BAM, bright PINK (not green this time) line right through the same spot as usually from top to bottom of the screen. Wanted to take a picture with my old phone but was afraid of leaving the error on the screen for too long (was busy using restroom) so I locked the phone and unlocked it again and the line went away. Man... I might return this thing because this is scaring me. So far the phone has been pretty great. One thing's for sure though, it's crazy the difference (s7 to s22+) 2 oz of weight (including cases) can feel while holding it. This thing feels like I'm holding a brick compared to my old phone lol. All of these things that I am giving it accolades for are, of course, from a biased perspective of somebody who has used the s7 since it's launch, so take it with a grain of salt if you are coming from something like an s20 or later. Great/Solid battery, Great performance, Great visuals. Little heavy though. Those are the main points. Since it is refurbished, the only actual visible damage you can see well is the small scratch at the bottom left corner of the screen (as seen in picture) that is on the glass for a length of about 2mm and then goes off to the side a bit. Not a problem though, it's quite out of the way. Saving around $350 just to have a scratch on the screen is quite the deal. I make my phones last, so this thing is going to be built like a tank by the time I'm done putting protective layers and cases on it. (This is the reason for the 4/5 and not 5/5) So far my only real scare with this phone (purchased as an excellent condition renewed s22+ with 256gb storage from Macalegin Electronics) is, since I've received it as of June 29th, it's now July 3rd, it's had this very thin vertical green line from the top of the screen to the bottom of the screen 3 times upon waking the phone. Seems to really only happen when I wake the phone. If I see it again I'll try to take a picture with my old phone and add it to the review. First time it happened I kinda had a mini freak-out, thinking that this is the end of having this phone and I gotta return it before it's too late and it gets worse. If it does get worse and more frequent, then I will get the refund because that's unacceptable as an excellent condition phone. Some people online say that it is because of a loose connection from the motherboard to the screen panel (I don't know the actual technical lingo), usually caused by the phone being dropped. Well, it's \"brand new\" to me, so it wasn't me who dropped it. Either way, the phone is great except for that scare. To be honest though, I do miss my more compact and sleek phone designs. I do kinda wish I had gotten the s22 instead, but I wanted to see what it's like having a bigger screen. Well, we'll see as the years go by.",

I am only giving it four stars becouse there was a prominent scuff going around the radius by the camera lense. According to their standards, a phone sold in excellent condition, which this was, should have no visual defects that can be seen from more than 12 inches away. this was clearly noticable. The cover I got for it covers the defect completely, so with the cover on it looks good. Overall, I am happy with the purchase and would have given 5 stars if it was sold in good condition rather than excellent.",
