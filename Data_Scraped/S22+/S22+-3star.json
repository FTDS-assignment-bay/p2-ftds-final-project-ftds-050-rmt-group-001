I CONTACTED CUSTOMER SUPPORT MULTIPLE TIMES THEY SENT ME A REPLACEMENT AND THAT WAS ALSO THE SMALLEST AMOUNT IT WASN'T UNTIL THE THIRD TIME THAT I GOT THE RIGHT SIZE GIGABYTES. BUT ONCE I GOT THE SIZE THAT I WANTED THE PHONE WAS PERFECT IT WAS FLAWLESS NO SCRATCHES NO NOTHING NO THINGS NO CRACKS EXACTLY WHAT I ORDERED EVEN TO THIS DAY I'M WRITING THIS REVIEW A COUPLE YEARS LATER WITH THE SAME PHONE SO AGAIN DOUBLE CHECK WHAT YOU ORDERED.
