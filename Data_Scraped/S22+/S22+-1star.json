    "review-text": "I just received this S22+ 256gb five minutes ago. The edges are all discolored (all four sides and four corners) and scratched, and if you run your finger tip down them you can feel the burs from the visible scrapes from where it had probably dropped to cause the gouging. And it’s not just one spot that you can feel the scrapes; they’re everywhere around the circumference of the phone. It’s on a table 3’ feet away from me now and it’s still worn out looking from here. Excellent condition? Not even close. Over $350 and this beat-up thing is what I received? Very disappointing. Not at all happy about this. It’s going back immediately.",
