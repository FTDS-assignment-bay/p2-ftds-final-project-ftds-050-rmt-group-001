Samsung's awful keyboard literally refuses to open on the front screen so frequently. -keyboard constaly suggests spelling for words that is incorrect. It will go out of its way to autocorrect words to be completely misplspelled. This keyboard is by far the worst of any phone company. The fact they force you to use it on the front screen is horrendous and malicious design. GIVE US OTHER FRONT SCREEN KEYBOARD OPTIONS. FIX THE UNRESPONSIVE FRONT SCREEN THIS IS A TERRIBLE USER EXPERIENCE FOR A PHONE THAY COSTS PREMIUM $$$",

    "review-text": "I really enjoy the versatility of this phone with being able to go from candy bar to tablet. Unfortunately, the Z Fold 7 is not compatible with any stylus since Samsung did not include the necessary screen layer required to use with a stylus so some of the Samsung apps like Note have wasted features which is a shame. With a screen like this and all the draw/handwriting functionality of Samsung Note it's actually really frustrating that they didn't include a stylus for this phone. It also lacks a lot of camera features and functions... I went from an S22 Ultra to this and I'm still debating whether or not I'm going to keep it since my S22 Ultra actually has more options than the Z Fold 7. It's like they're engineering in the wrong direction but charging MORE for less. Unfortunately, Samsung is still the best option on the market right now and they know it.",
