Yeah!  is the big screen neat?  yeah to some regard...for watching movies maybe? but it's still an android os operating system, i just didn't find it exceptional in any way.  it did not improve my productivity in any way........and while it was well built, for me it felt like an overpriced toy vs a serious piece of hardware.",

    "review-text": "I'd say this was really close to 5 stars, but I took one off for a few things: 1). Charging speed is really not great.  2 1/2 hours to fully charge.  My iPhone 16 Pro was far faster.  The big thing is to make sure you use a 25W charging block.  Just sticking it into any ol' charging block will end up much longer, most likely.  Yesterday, I was charging at 15W using a charging block with like 8 USB ports.  I didn't realize that 4 of those ports charge at only 5W.  Two others at 12 or 15W.  And two at 20W.  Going from 12/15W to 20W chopped 30 minutes off the charge time, which was 1 1/2 hours, at that point.  The phone will only charge up to 25W.  Other phones are 45 on up. 2)  Speakers kinda suck.  My iPhone 16 Pro was much better, and it wasn't great.  But... it's not that big a deal.  I'm not listening to anything that important on my phone. 3). Getting used to an Android phone again, after 6 years of an iPhone, (had Android since Android phones first came out), is it a bit of doing, but not that bad. 4).  The crease is not completely gone, but apparently much better than the Fold 6.  I'd like to see it gone completely, bu... it's really not an issue in real world use.  You don't really see it until turn the phone and catch some glare. 4).  I hate that I lose the ability to send text messages from my Mac's iMessage app.  This is truly the only REAL negative.  The other 4 above are minor.  But... I can use a free bit of software called Blue Bubble to allow me to do this.  I haven't set it up, yet, but... with working there's nothing to not recommend this awesome piece of tech.  Truly super cool.",

    "review-text": "2 screens are great. I use the main screen like a regular phone. Much speedier than my S22Ultra. The 2nd screen is okay, more screen real estate but awkward to use. My main concern is that the camer doesn't deliver as sharp an image as my old one did, even with a 200 MP image! A phone case is an absolute must. And a lens cover! I have 512GB storage because anything less seems short-sighted, especially with a 200 MP camera. I can't talk about value for the money because who pays $2k for a phone when they want value?",

    "review-text": "The Galaxy Z Fold 7 feels like the future of smartphones in your hand. The design is sleek, with a more durable hinge and a nearly flawless 7.6-inch display when unfolded. The screen is vibrant, sharp, and perfect for multitasking—whether you're browsing, working, or gaming. Performance is lightning fast. Apps open in a flash, and running multiple apps side-by-side feels like a breeze. As for the cameras, they’re solid—50MP main camera takes great photos, though it's not quite up to par with the Galaxy S series. Battery life is decent, lasting through a full day of heavy use, and the 25W fast charging is a nice touch. The software is where it shines, with One UI offering amazing features for multitaskers. I love how you can run three apps at once or use Flex Mode for hands-free use. The Z Fold 7 is definitely a premium device, so the price is steep. But if you’re into cutting-edge tech and love the idea of a phone that doubles as a tablet, it’s hard to beat. Pros: Gorgeous, durable screen Fast performance, great for multitasking Solid camera setup Smooth software experience Cons: Pricey Camera could be better for the price",

    "review-text": "The \"Qi2-ready\" mark would benefit from more detail.  Here are some thoughts:  The  camera lenses (with or without a case) is an uneven surface that causes built-in car Qi wireless chargers to display an obstruction error in one car and to overheat in another car. Suggestions:  Amazon offers some excellent cases with appropriate Magsafe or Qi2 magnets.  Successfully identified a phone case where the protruding camera island protective trim is partially cut away such as not to obstruct a Magsafe/Qi2 power bank.  Happily ordered a couple Qi2 power banks.  Ordered up a bunch of Magsafe/Qi2 charging adapters from Amazon to replace all the older non-magnetic Qi wireless chargers. If the phone overheats during wireless charging, try wired or maybe experiment with Google partial workaround:  setting > battery > Charging Settings > Fast Wireless Charging > off.  Wired or wireless, maybe charge on a repurposed metal cookie tin to act as a passive heat sink.",
