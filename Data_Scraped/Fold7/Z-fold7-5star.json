    "review-text": "I’ve used Samsung’s Ultra and Note series for years, so I’m very familiar with wide, boxy phones and large displays. That’s why, when I first got the Z Fold 7, the cover screen initially felt narrow compared to what I was used to. In height it’s almost the same, but the width seemed smaller. However, this feeling only lasted a few days—once I adjusted, I realized the cover display is more than enough for everyday use. In fact, it’s very similar in size to the S25 Plus, and you can comfortably run any app on it. The magic happens when you unfold it. The internal display is huge, immersive, and makes you forget about missing the wider Ultra screen. You can run two apps side by side, or one above the other, almost like having two phones in one. For example, you can keep your email open on one side while chatting or receiving information on the other—copying, pasting, and multitasking without constantly switching apps. You can also watch a video on one half while replying to emails, chatting on WhatsApp, or doing other tasks on the other half. It’s an unmatched experience that no regular phone can offer. Multitasking and Apps Multitasking on the Fold is incredible. Editing photos, playing games, or browsing is simply more fun on such a large display. Most apps are optimized because Samsung’s software is excellent, and social apps like Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook look fantastic. If you ever prefer a narrower aspect ratio, you can quickly switch any app to “slim mode” through the multitasking options. Addressing the Haters’ Complaints Under-display camera: You can enable a black bar in apps to hide the camera area, so it never gets in the way. S Pen: While there’s no built-in S Pen slot, you can use a capacitive S Pen. By enabling “increased touch sensitivity” (especially if you use a tempered glass screen protector), it works very well for everyday use. Battery life: After weeks of use, I can confirm the battery lasts all day. With adaptive power saving and dark mode, I’ve managed up to 10 hours of screen time on the cover screen, and 7–8 hours with mixed cover and main screen use. Heavy gaming or demanding apps bring it down to 5–6 hours, which is still solid. To preserve long-term battery health, I recommend enabling battery protection (charging to 90–95%) and avoiding letting it drop below 30%. Cameras For 99% of users, the cameras are more than enough. The biggest advantage is using the high-quality rear cameras for selfies or streaming, which no standard phone—including the Ultra series—can match. Plus, when taking photos of others, they can preview themselves on the cover screen. Photos, selfies, and videos are sharp and vibrant. While professionals may prefer the S25 Ultra for advanced photography, the Fold’s versatility makes it an excellent choice for almost everyone. Final Thoughts The Z Fold 7 is an outstanding phone. Even if you’re coming from an Ultra, it only takes a few days to adjust before you realize you don’t miss the wider display. In fact, Ultras feel bulky and brick-like compared to the Fold, which is slimmer, more comfortable to hold, and far more versatile. The cover screen is fully usable for everyday apps, and when you want something larger, unfolding gives you a massive display that no traditional phone can match. I don’t regret switching at all—this is easily one of the best devices I’ve ever used, and I highly recommend it.",

    "review-text": "I've been a lifelong Samsung user. I've had their Galaxy Note, s2, s8, fold3 and now switched to the Flip 7. I loved the Fold3 but screen ended up not opening all the way and felt a bit heavy in the pockets. I needed something small and light. Amazon had a $200 gift card deal for flip 7 pre-orders, so that looked good to me. Once I got it, it's pretty good. Feels premium. The battery life is good. Durability is good so far. Time will tell if it holds up better than my fold3. I like using the smaller screen for games and browsing the web. It's also an easier way for me to view and change what I'm listening to rather than opening up the phone. Camera is good too. People get impressed when they see themselves on the selfie screen. I can't wait for the next version to make the outer screen like a regular smart phone instead of it currently relying on apps and widgets to be installed using big screen. Next version should also make the mini screen text friendly. I can send messages using it but it takes up the majority of the screen. Can't really see replies. One downside is that the connection drops. My mobile data symbol sometimes show a circle ⭕ with a line though it even when I'm in a good service area. Doesn't happen often though which is good. One of the functions I like is when I'm watching a YouTube video on the small screen, the volume up and down button get swapped, and works like it was intended. Volume down on big screen would be volume up when it's closed. I love that they thought of that. In the end, it's a great value for anyone looking for a minimal phone.",

Durability factor will be tested more in the long term, but I got a great case for it I'm the meantime. It doesn't overheat as much under heavy use as some people said. The Exynos chipset is not slow at all and can definitely compete with other modern devices. It's no Snapdragon, but it's certainly quick and worth the money which is a pleasant surprise. The camera is totally fine. People are comparing it to the S25 Ultra camera or an iPhone pro camera when they need to compare it to a base model S25 or iPhone. It will suffice for most needs. It doesn't have ultra wideband. But that's something that most people won't notice or miss. The blue color is the absolute best and perfect. It's an eye catching color. Being able to flip to answer and end calls brings back a wonderful feeling of nostalgia from my old flip phones of 2 decades ago. Make sure you get the Samsung Care insurance with it.",

Love taking selfies with the phone closed, and the \"raise your hand\" feature makes it easy to take photos. Also, I love the coral color! It's a slim feel without the case, but a bit bulky with a protector. I would rather keep my phone safe so case it is for me. Overall: cute, convenient, fast and fun!",

    "review-text": "Wife absolutely loves it! I put a Spigen glass protector on the front. When folded it's so compact, fits in her back pocket with ease and in her purse it's completey protected from scratches cuz the main screen is not exposed. Also can fit in tiny accessory purses! I know the camera is not the biggest bestest badest flagship camera, but it's still a great camera (it can't do 200x zoom, but turns out my wife never even did a 50x zoom on her S22 so it was a non-issue for us). Also lots of reviews of the battery being out of step with all other phones these days, but again, for her she typically arrives at home with 50~60% battery remaining, so also a non-issue. A quick tip for protecting your inner main screen. Do not add any 3rd party screen protectors, marketers will promote them with influencers. It already has one installed from Samsung factory. If you scratch it up, you simply take it to a Samsung repair shop (like ufix) and for $20 they'll swap out the protector for a new one.",

    "review-text": "I just love the samsung fold phone. Unfolded to use tablet mode is a game changer. Don't get me wrong the price is steep but to be able to use my phone that functions as a tablet at work really helps pass the time. I've dropped it once and no damage so the durability is good so far. However its important to nose some paint has scratched off around the charge port. The paint around that area scratched off from my trying to insert the charger so be aware of that but to me personally is not a big deal. The phone is REALLY LIGHT. It weights about the same to my apple 13 mini iphone yet is much bigger and is about the same thickness UNFOLDED. Yet once you fold it into the tablet form its thinner then the iPhone 13 mini by a substantial amount. The color accuracy is pretty good. Trust me it doesn't get any better then this. Battery life lasts around 8-10 hours but I couldn't say for sure because I always play games on my phone so obviously its gonna drain battery more quickly but I personally am satisfied with how long it last. I bought the phone while on sale for $1699 which is still steep from the $2000. I can't get over the fact it can turn into a tablet. It's hard to say if its worth its price point but all I can say is I don't regret buying it even if admittedly it did put a hole in my pocket",
