    "review-text": "The form factor is the best. The screen works fine. I have had four Samsung flip phones. The ability to put it in your front pocket and still sit down is great. How easy it is to hold in your hand and not drop is great. The fact that you just flip it closed and it ends your session is great. The problem is that Samsung and to some extent Android in general have such horrible flaws. With speech to text, Samsung doesn't understand the exact commands they tell you they do. New line, new paragraph, Etc. As I remember, even if you say the word comma, it types that out instead of actually putting in the punctuation. Samsung was told about this by numerous people for the last 4 years or so and they've never addressed it. The result is that almost everybody uses gboard. Theoretically gboard is not as secure. Also, even if you're using gboard as your keyboard, Samsung doesn't allow you to remove theirs. It will capitalize odd words that are sometimes used as names. It will capitalize the first letter of a first name, but not the first letter of the last name that follows. As far as the flip phone goes, check things like resolution of the screen. You'll find that even the main screen is far below normal bar phone screens and even their own s25 Plus. So it's a mixed bag. If you don't use dictation it can probably be wonderful because of the form factor and because you get a very big screen when it's open. If you use dictation, forget about it.  I am switching to another phone. If Samsung and or Android we get there act together when it comes to dictation, I would stick with it. Of course that is if they would stop lying and saying it'll be fixed in a couple of weeks or it will be fixed with the next update.",

    "review-text": "This is the 3rd Samsung ZFlip phones I've had.  Started with the Z flip 4, and the screen went black from the center of the fold out to the edge.  It progressed so you could see no phone, but it still worked if you knew where to poke the black screen.  Took it to the phone repair shop and they replaced all the guts on it.  This happened on month 4 of owning it.  That phone bricked at 14 months, so I bought another z flip s4.  It lasted just over a year and started running super slow,  If I swiped on the screen it was in super slow motion.  That is when I bought the z flip 7 on July 24, 2025.  I didn't even open the box until mid-August.  Now it's been a month, and the inside main screen has gone black again. It is under warantee, so it's going to the shop tomorrow.  But I will never buy another Samsung Z flip again.  I thought it was cool, and safer to not break the screen, but it has not been a good fit.  I'm in my late 60s, and don't open the dang thing a 1000 times a day.  Jeez.",

    "review-text": "I moved from a Apple 12 Pro Max to a new Z 7. I've only had it for three days now but my first impression isn't good. I will say the reason for my purchase was for the large screen. I'm hard of hearing and the screen size is wonderful if you need to use speech to text software. However, at this point I'm very frustrated that ALL apps that I add from Samsung store have advertisements!!!! Apple app downloads never had adds! I'll give another review after a few weeks and see if I can find apps from another location other than Samsung. After getting used to Samsung I'm still not impressed. In my phone book there isn't a map function to see where the address is? Apple made that real easy in the address book also when adding credit cards to the wallet I had to enter all of them manually? So, maybe I'll update my review later.",

So if u are rich,tech savvy,  and need all that extra stuff the fold if for u , but I don't want to have to use a manual  to use my phone !",
