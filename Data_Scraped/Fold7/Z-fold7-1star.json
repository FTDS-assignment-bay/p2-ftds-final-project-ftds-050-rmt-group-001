Went to have it looked at since just got it, didn't drop, no water damage...nothing.  The guy at the fix it place said that it must have been from pressing down and the newer phones screens are much more sensitive these days.  Just a way to have to spend more money on parts, their insurance or new phone.  These phones cost way too much for them to break by touch. Won't purchase again",

I've reached out to Samsung customer service and over an hour later I'm still waiting for service. From 41st to now 29th. I'll update later. So after spending hours with Samsung's customer care troubleshooting nothing worked and the cover screen is still blank. I am returning to Amazon. However, I am unable to purchase a new one at the preorder price which is unfair because it's not my fault I received a damaged product. So I'd have to pay $500 more to re-purchase. Not worth it.",
